# GM Guidelines for Callings

## Calling Benefits in Action

### Adjudicating Flow Benefits
- **Require authentic motivation** - actions must genuinely align with the Calling
- **Scene limits prevent abuse** - most are once per scene
- **Let players invoke them** - but verify the connection to their Calling
- **Reward creative applications** that stay true to character
- **Stack with other sources** - Calling benefits add to normal Flow generation

When determining if a Flow Benefit triggers, ask:
1. Does this action genuinely express the character's Calling?
2. Has this benefit already been used this scene (if limited)?
3. Does this create an interesting narrative moment?

If the answer to these questions is "yes," allow the benefit to trigger.

#### Example Adjudication

**Good Trigger:** The Guardian rushes into danger to shield innocents from an avalanche. This clearly expresses their core drive to help others, puts them at personal risk, and creates a dramatic moment.

**Questionable Trigger:** The Guardian heals a wealthy merchant who offered them a large reward. While technically "helping," this doesn't express their core drive authentically - it's motivated by self-interest rather than genuine care.

**Poor Trigger:** The Guardian attempts to retroactively claim they were "helping" by attacking a foe, simply to gain the Flow benefit. Combat actions need to specifically express protection or service to qualify.

### Managing Narrative Permissions
- **Say yes when possible** - these define what makes characters special
- **Provide useful information** - make permissions feel valuable
- **Don't let them bypass everything** - major mysteries remain mysterious
- **Use them for worldbuilding** - what characters notice reveals the world
- **Enhance scenes** - permissions create unique character moments

When a player invokes a Narrative Permission, consider:
1. What interesting information can this reveal?
2. How can this move the story forward?
3. What limitations might apply in this situation?

Always provide something of value when a Narrative Permission is used, even if it can't completely solve the problem at hand.

#### Example Permission Use

**Strong Use:** The Seeker asks the captured cultist, "What do you truly fear about the ritual you're performing?" The cultist must answer honestly, revealing their secret fear that the summoned entity will consume them first.

**Creative Use:** The Enthusiast's Silver Lining permission reveals that the collapsing tunnel has created vibrations that are attracting cave worms - creatures that might be followed to another exit.

**Limited Use:** The Advocate's Truth Sense detects that the king is lying about corruption, but cannot reveal the specific details of the truth - only that deception is occurring.

## NPCs and Callings

Major NPCs should have clear Callings that inform their motivations and actions. This creates more consistent, believable characters and helps players understand their perspective.

### Implementing NPC Callings
- Give major NPCs one clear Calling that drives their actions
- Allow their Calling to influence their decision-making
- Use their Calling to determine their approach to problems
- Consider both healthy and unhealthy expressions of their Calling

### Villain Callings
Villains with well-defined Callings create more compelling antagonists:

- **Advocate Villain:** A zealot who believes their harsh "justice" is necessary purification
- **Guardian Villain:** A controlling figure who believes others cannot survive without them
- **Exemplar Villain:** An ambitious leader who sacrifices others for their success
- **Scholar Villain:** An obsessive researcher who ignores ethical boundaries in pursuit of knowledge
- **Champion Villain:** A tyrant who believes might makes right and force justifies control

### Calling-Based NPC Reactions

NPCs react differently to the same situation based on their Calling:

**Scenario: A village needs protection from bandits**

- **Advocate NPC:** Organizes a militia to establish justice
- **Guardian NPC:** Personally takes responsibility for protecting the vulnerable
- **Exemplar NPC:** Sees it as an opportunity to prove their worth and gain recognition
- **Seeker NPC:** Uses the crisis to discover what kind of person they truly are
- **Scholar NPC:** Studies bandit patterns to develop optimal defense strategies
- **Sentinel NPC:** Creates security protocols and prepares contingencies
- **Enthusiast NPC:** Finds excitement in the danger while keeping spirits high
- **Champion NPC:** Takes charge and leads the defense through strength
- **Mediator NPC:** Attempts to negotiate with the bandits while preparing defense

## Moral Complexity

Callings shine when presented with morally complex situations that challenge their core drives. These create rich roleplaying opportunities and character growth.

### Creating Moral Challenges
- Present situations where different Callings suggest different "right" actions
- Avoid making any Calling inherently good or evil
- Show consequences of taking Callings to extremes
- Reward players for authentic character choices
- Create ethical dilemmas that challenge each Calling

### Example Dilemmas by Calling

**Advocate Dilemma:** The corrupt official deserves justice, but punishing them will cause suffering to innocent dependents.

**Guardian Dilemma:** Two people need help simultaneously - helping one means abandoning the other.

**Exemplar Dilemma:** Success in the mission requires sacrificing personal integrity or harming a teammate.

**Seeker Dilemma:** Being true to yourself means breaking from group consensus on an important decision.

**Scholar Dilemma:** The knowledge you seek is dangerous and might be better left undiscovered.

**Sentinel Dilemma:** Your loyalty is demanded by two conflicting authorities.

**Enthusiast Dilemma:** The immediate pleasurable choice threatens long-term happiness.

**Champion Dilemma:** Protecting one group requires abandoning another to their fate.

**Mediator Dilemma:** True peace requires a difficult confrontation rather than compromise.

## Campaign Themes

Different Callings suggest different campaign styles and themes. Consider emphasizing certain themes based on your party's Calling composition.

### Mixed Calling Party Dynamics

In parties with diverse Callings, emphasize:

- **Complementary approaches** to problems
- **Creative tensions** between different moral perspectives
- **Growth opportunities** as characters influence each other
- **Varied challenges** that give different Callings moments to shine

## Using Callings in World Building
