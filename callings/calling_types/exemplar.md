## Playing an Exemplar
Your drive for achievement motivates the party forward. Set clear goals and celebrate victories, but remember that your worth isn't solely in your accomplishments. Growth comes from finding value in who you are, not just what you do.

## Tactical Approach

Before the fight, she assessed the situation and knew instinctively: "The other bandits will flee if their leader falls."*
