# Calling Evolution Patterns

## Introduction to Calling Growth

Callings are not static labels but dynamic frameworks that evolve as characters develop. This evolution follows predictable patterns based on the Enneagram system, with each Calling having characteristic growth and stress directions. Understanding these patterns helps players create compelling character arcs and provides GMs with tools to create meaningful character development opportunities.

## Core Evolution Principles

### Callings Change But Don't Disappear
- Characters never completely lose their core Calling
- Evolution means integrating new aspects rather than replacement
- Original motivations remain but become more nuanced

### Three Types of Evolution
1. **Deepening** - More mature expression of the same Calling
2. **Integration** - Incorporating positive aspects of growth direction
3. **Disintegration** - Exhibiting negative aspects of stress direction

### Milestone Connection
- Minor Milestones often represent Deepening
- Moderate Milestones can trigger Integration opportunities
- Major Milestones may involve significant evolution

## Stress Directions

When under extreme pressure, characters may exhibit unhealthy aspects of another Calling. This "disintegration" represents how core drives manifest when a person feels threatened or insecure.

### Full Stress Direction Map
- **Advocate → Exemplar**: Becomes obsessed with being seen as perfect
- **Guardian → Champion**: Becomes controlling and domineering
- **Exemplar → Mediator**: Becomes apathetic and disengaged
- **Seeker → Guardian**: Becomes clingy and dependent
- **Scholar → Enthusiast**: Becomes scattered and hyperactive
- **Sentinel → Exemplar**: Becomes competitive and status-focused
- **Enthusiast → Advocate**: Becomes critical and perfectionistic
- **Champion → Scholar**: Retreats into isolation and planning
- **Mediator → Sentinel**: Becomes anxious and reactive

### Stress Indicators

## Growth Directions

When secure and developing positively, characters integrate healthy aspects of another Calling. This "integration" represents psychological maturity and balance.

## Implementing Evolution in Play

### Player-Driven Evolution
Encourage players to:
- Identify their Calling's stress and growth directions
- Notice when their character exhibits stress behaviors
- Actively pursue growth opportunities
- Consider how milestones might trigger evolution

### GM-Facilitated Evolution

#### Stress Direction Triggers
- **Advocate:** Moral dilemmas with no clear right answer
- **Guardian:** Loved ones rejecting their help
- **Exemplar:** Significant failure or public humiliation
- **Seeker:** Identity-threatening situations
- **Scholar:** Information overload or analysis paralysis
- **Sentinel:** Betrayal of trust or security breach
- **Enthusiast:** Forced confinement or limitation
- **Champion:** Loss of control or authority
- **Mediator:** Irreconcilable conflict

#### Growth Direction Opportunities
- **Advocate:** Chances to find joy in imperfection
- **Guardian:** Opportunities for self-discovery and expression
- **Exemplar:** Situations requiring loyalty over recognition
- **Seeker:** Causes worthy of their commitment
- **Scholar:** Crises requiring immediate action
- **Sentinel:** Safe spaces to practice trust
- **Enthusiast:** Deep study opportunities with meaningful payoff
- **Champion:** Situations where vulnerability is strength
- **Mediator:** Leadership opportunities with clear goals

### Mechanical Evolution Options

#### Flow Benefit Evolution
As characters evolve, their Flow benefits can reflect this growth:

- **Enhanced Benefit:** Same trigger but improved effect
- **Expanded Trigger:** Same effect but more ways to activate
- **Hybrid Benefit:** Combines aspects of original and growth direction

#### Example Evolved Benefits

**Advocate Evolution (Righteous Fury → Righteous Joy)**
- **Original:** Gain 1 Flow when exposing corruption/injustice
- **Evolved:** Gain 1 Flow when exposing corruption/injustice OR when helping others find joy in difficult circumstances

**Champion Evolution (Protective Dominance → Protective Nurturing)**
- **Original:** +1 Flow when protecting others in Aggressive stance
- **Evolved:** +1 Flow when protecting others in any stance, with additional beneficial effect for the protected ally

## Character Evolution Arcs

### Short-Term Evolution (5-10 sessions)
- Character exhibits occasional stress behaviors
- Begins noticing growth direction opportunities
- No mechanical changes yet

### Medium-Term Evolution (10-20 sessions)
- Character consciously works on growth direction
- Stress behaviors become less frequent
- Flow benefit might begin to evolve

### Long-Term Evolution (20+ sessions)
- Character regularly exhibits growth direction qualities
- Stress direction manifests only in extreme circumstances
- Flow benefit fully evolved to reflect growth

## Advanced Evolution: Calling Transformations

In rare circumstances, usually after Major Milestones involving profound character development, a character's primary Calling might shift entirely. This represents fundamental transformation of core motivation.

### Requirements for Transformation
- Extensive roleplaying groundwork
- Major narrative turning point
- Unanimous table agreement (player, GM, other players)
- Mechanical rebalancing (Flow benefits, etc.)

### Example Transformations
- **Guardian to Advocate:** From protecting individuals to fighting systemic injustice
- **Scholar to Seeker:** From external knowledge to internal understanding
- **Champion to Mediator:** From enforcing peace through strength to creating harmony through understanding

## Practical Applications

### For Players

- Consider how your character might evolve over the campaign
- Talk with your GM about evolution goals for your character

### For Game Masters
- Create scenarios that challenge characters' stress points
- Provide opportunities aligned with growth directions
- Recognize and reward character evolution
- Use NPC Callings to demonstrate different evolution stages

### For Groups
- Discuss how character evolutions might affect party dynamics
- Consider campaign themes that support meaningful evolution
- Create collaborative story moments that mark evolution milestones
