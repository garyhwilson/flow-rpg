# How Callings Evolve

## Callings Are Living Things

Callings are not static labels but dynamic frameworks that evolve as characters develop. A Guardian at the start of a campaign isn't the same Guardian at the end - their core drive to protect remains, but it matures, deepens, and sometimes fractures under pressure.

## The Shape of Growth

### Your Calling Grows With You

Consider Sera, a Guardian Cleric. Early in her career, she protected people by standing between them and physical harm - simple, direct, immediate. As she matured, her understanding of protection deepened. Now she establishes clinics, trains healers, and builds systems that protect people even when she's not there. Same Calling, more nuanced expression.

This **deepening** represents the most common form of Calling evolution. The core motivation remains, but its expression becomes more sophisticated.

### Learning From Other Callings

Sometimes growth means incorporating strengths from other Callings. Sir Aldric, a Champion, discovered that his drive to lead and achieve could be enriched by the Scholar's love of wisdom. He didn't stop being a Champion - but he learned to lead through understanding rather than force alone.

This **integration** often happens during moderate milestones, when characters face challenges that reveal the limits of their current approach.

### Breaking Under Pressure

Growth isn't always positive. Under extreme stress, characters may exhibit unhealthy versions of other Callings. When Sera the Guardian feels overwhelmed and unappreciated, she sometimes becomes controlling and domineering - the dark side of the Champion, demanding gratitude for her sacrifices.

This **disintegration** represents how core drives can twist when a character feels threatened.

## Stress Directions

When under extreme pressure, characters may exhibit unhealthy aspects of another Calling. This "disintegration" represents how core drives manifest when a person feels threatened or insecure.

## Implementing Evolution in Play

### Player-Driven Evolution
Encourage players to:
- Identify their Calling's stress and growth directions
- Notice when their character exhibits stress behaviors
- Actively pursue growth opportunities
- Consider how milestones might trigger evolution

### GM-Facilitated Evolution

#### Stress Direction Triggers
- **Advocate:** Moral dilemmas with no clear right answer
- **Guardian:** Loved ones rejecting their help
- **Exemplar:** Significant failure or public humiliation
- **Seeker:** Identity-threatening situations
- **Scholar:** Information overload or analysis paralysis
- **Sentinel:** Betrayal of trust or security breach
- **Enthusiast:** Forced confinement or limitation
- **Champion:** Loss of control or authority
- **Mediator:** Irreconcilable conflict

#### Growth Direction Opportunities
- **Advocate:** Chances to find joy in imperfection
- **Guardian:** Opportunities for self-discovery and expression
- **Exemplar:** Situations requiring loyalty over recognition
- **Seeker:** Causes worthy of their commitment
- **Scholar:** Crises requiring immediate action
- **Sentinel:** Safe spaces to practice trust
- **Enthusiast:** Deep study opportunities with meaningful payoff
- **Champion:** Situations where vulnerability is strength
- **Mediator:** Leadership opportunities with clear goals

### Mechanical Evolution Options

#### Flow Benefit Evolution
As characters evolve, their Flow benefits can reflect this growth:

- **Enhanced Benefit:** Same trigger but improved effect
- **Expanded Trigger:** Same effect but more ways to activate
- **Hybrid Benefit:** Combines aspects of original and growth direction

#### Example Evolved Benefits

**Advocate Evolution (Righteous Fury → Righteous Joy)**
- **Original:** Gain 1 Flow when exposing corruption/injustice
- **Evolved:** Gain 1 Flow when exposing corruption/injustice OR when helping others find joy in difficult circumstances

**Champion Evolution (Protective Dominance → Protective Nurturing)**
- **Original:** +1 Flow when protecting others in Aggressive stance
- **Evolved:** +1 Flow when protecting others in any stance, with additional beneficial effect for the protected ally

## Character Evolution Arcs

### Short-Term Evolution (5-10 sessions)
- Character exhibits occasional stress behaviors
- Begins noticing growth direction opportunities
- No mechanical changes yet

### Medium-Term Evolution (10-20 sessions)
- Character consciously works on growth direction
- Stress behaviors become less frequent
- Flow benefit might begin to evolve

### Long-Term Evolution (20+ sessions)
- Character regularly exhibits growth direction qualities
- Stress direction manifests only in extreme circumstances
- Flow benefit fully evolved to reflect growth

## Advanced Evolution: Calling Transformations

In rare circumstances, usually after Major Milestones involving profound character development, a character's primary Calling might shift entirely. This represents fundamental transformation of core motivation.

### Requirements for Transformation
- Extensive roleplaying groundwork
- Major narrative turning point
- Unanimous table agreement (player, GM, other players)
- Mechanical rebalancing (Flow benefits, etc.)

### Example Transformations
- **Guardian to Advocate:** From protecting individuals to fighting systemic injustice
- **Scholar to Seeker:** From external knowledge to internal understanding
- **Champion to Mediator:** From enforcing peace through strength to creating harmony through understanding

## Practical Applications

### For Game Masters
- Create scenarios that challenge characters' stress points
- Provide opportunities aligned with growth directions
- Recognize and reward character evolution
- Use NPC Callings to demonstrate different evolution stages

### For Groups
- Discuss how character evolutions might affect party dynamics
