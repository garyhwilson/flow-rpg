## Momentum and Callings

The Momentum system is deeply integrated with Callings, creating a resource economy that reinforces character motivation.

### Momentum Generation through Callings

Each Calling generates Momentum through actions aligned with their core drive:

### How Each Calling Spends Momentum

Your Calling shapes not just when you gain Momentum, but how you instinctively want to spend it.

**Advocates** save their Momentum for moments of revelation. When Marcus the Advocate finally confronts the corrupt magistrate, he pours 3 Momentum into _Righteous Revelation_ - the truth spills out whether the magistrate wants it to or not. Every coin skimmed, every bribe taken, laid bare.

**Guardians** spend Momentum protecting others. Sera sees the arrow flying toward the young prince and burns 2 Momentum on _Guardian's Intercession_, throwing herself into its path. The wound hurts, but the prince lives.

**Exemplars** invest Momentum in moments that will be remembered. Kael the duelist saves his Momentum for the climactic exchange, then spends 3 Momentum on _Perfect Performance_ - his bladework becomes poetry, witnessed by the assembled nobles.

**Seekers** spend Momentum to be truly themselves. When the priest demands Lyra conform to tradition, she burns 2 Momentum on _True Self_, speaking her mind despite the social pressure that would normally silence her.

**Scholars** hoard Momentum for critical insights. Brother Aldric has been saving Momentum all session. When the party needs to decipher the ancient text, he spends 2 Momentum on _Perfect Recall_, remembering a footnote from a book he read twenty years ago.

**Sentinels** spend Momentum on vigilance. Captain Thorne burns 3 Momentum on _Perfect Vigilance_ before entering the warehouse - every trap, every hidden enemy, every escape route revealed to his keen awareness.

**Enthusiasts** share their Momentum freely. Pip spends 2 Momentum on _Boundless Optimism_ to lift the despair from a wounded companion - their pain doesn't disappear, but suddenly it feels bearable.

**Champions** spend Momentum on decisive action. When the enemy champion stands between her and victory, Valeria pours 4 Momentum into _Overwhelming Force_ - one strike that ends the duel.

**Mediators** spend Momentum on understanding. Ambassador Kai burns 3 Momentum on _Perfect Understanding_ - suddenly the trade negotiation makes sense, the hidden agendas clear, the path to agreement obvious.
