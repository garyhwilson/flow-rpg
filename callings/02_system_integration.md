# Callings System Integration

## Flow and Callings

The Flow system is deeply integrated with Callings, creating a resource economy that reinforces character motivation.

### Flow Generation through Callings

Each Calling generates Flow through actions aligned with their core drive:

**Advocate:** Exposing corruption or injustice (+1 Flow)
**Guardian:** When allies become seriously injured (+1 Flow)
**Exemplar:** Critical success toward declared goals (+2 Flow)
**Seeker:** Authentic unconventional actions (+1 Flow)
**Scholar:** Knowledge-based actions (can bank up to 2 Flow)
**Sentinel:** Any Flow gain also adds +1 Guard
**Enthusiast:** Can transfer gained Flow to allies
**Champion:** Extra Flow in Aggressive stance when protecting (+1 Flow)
**Mediator:** Resolving conflicts peacefully (+1 Flow)

### How Each Calling Spends Flow

Your Calling shapes not just when you gain Flow, but how you instinctively want to spend it.

**Advocates** save their Flow for moments of revelation. When Marcus the Advocate finally confronts the corrupt magistrate, he pours 3 Flow into *Righteous Revelation* - the truth spills out whether the magistrate wants it to or not. Every coin skimmed, every bribe taken, laid bare.

**Guardians** spend Flow protecting others. Sera sees the arrow flying toward the young prince and burns 2 Flow on *Guardian's Intercession*, throwing herself into its path. The wound hurts, but the prince lives.

**Exemplars** invest Flow in moments that will be remembered. Kael the duelist saves his Flow for the climactic exchange, then spends 3 Flow on *Perfect Performance* - his bladework becomes poetry, witnessed by the assembled nobles.

**Seekers** spend Flow to be truly themselves. When the priest demands Lyra conform to tradition, she burns 2 Flow on *True Self*, speaking her mind despite the social pressure that would normally silence her.

**Scholars** hoard Flow for critical insights. Brother Aldric has been saving Flow all session. When the party needs to decipher the ancient text, he spends 2 Flow on *Perfect Recall*, remembering a footnote from a book he read twenty years ago.

**Sentinels** spend Flow on vigilance. Captain Thorne burns 3 Flow on *Perfect Vigilance* before entering the warehouse - every trap, every hidden enemy, every escape route revealed to his keen awareness.

**Enthusiasts** share their Flow freely. Pip spends 2 Flow on *Boundless Optimism* to lift the despair from a wounded companion - their pain doesn't disappear, but suddenly it feels bearable.

**Champions** spend Flow on decisive action. When the enemy champion stands between her and victory, Valeria pours 4 Flow into *Overwhelming Force* - one strike that ends the duel.

**Mediators** spend Flow on understanding. Ambassador Kai burns 3 Flow on *Perfect Understanding* - suddenly the trade negotiation makes sense, the hidden agendas clear, the path to agreement obvious.

## Combat Stances and Callings
