# Callings System
*Character Motivation & Moral Compass*

## Introduction

Callings replace traditional alignment by providing a deeper framework for character motivation and decision-making. Based on the Enneagram system, each Calling represents a core drive that shapes how characters view the world and make moral choices. Unlike alignment, Callings are descriptive rather than prescriptive - they explain why characters act, not what they must do.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Motivation over restriction** - Callings guide rather than limit choices
- **Complex morality** - Every Calling can produce heroes or villains
- **Character growth** - Callings can evolve through play
- **Universal application** - Works across all genres and character types
- **Flow integration** - Each Calling provides unique benefits that interact with the Flow system

## Calling Benefits

Each Calling provides two unique benefits that reinforce its core identity:

### Flow Benefit
A mechanical interaction with the Flow system that triggers when acting in alignment with your Calling. These benefits encourage authentic roleplay by rewarding Calling-appropriate actions with Flow advantages.

### Narrative Permission
A special capability that requires no roll - your Calling grants you unique insight or ability in specific situations. These permissions empower creative problem-solving and character-driven moments.

**Important:** Benefits only function when genuinely aligned with your Calling's motivation. The GM has final say on whether an action qualifies, keeping the focus on authentic character portrayal rather than mechanical optimization.
