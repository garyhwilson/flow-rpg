# Basic Mechanics

This chapter covers the fundamental rules that power [Your Game Name].

## The Core Mechanic

<!-- Define your core resolution mechanic here -->

When your character attempts something with an uncertain outcome, you:

1. **Describe** what you're trying to do
2. **Roll** [describe dice]
3. **Add** relevant modifiers
4. **Compare** to the target number

If your total meets or exceeds the target, you succeed.

### Example

> *Kira wants to leap across a chasm to escape the guards.*
>
> The GM calls for an Agility check against a target of 12.
>
> Kira's player rolls [dice], getting [result]. Adding her Agility modifier of +2, her total is [total].
>
> [Result description]

## Target Numbers

The Game Master sets target numbers based on difficulty:

<!-- YAML-SOURCE: example_system.yaml > derived_values > defense -->
<!-- Replace with your actual target number scale -->
| Difficulty | Target Number |
|------------|---------------|
| Easy       | 8             |
| Normal     | 12            |
| Hard       | 16            |
| Very Hard  | 20            |
<!-- /YAML-SOURCE -->
