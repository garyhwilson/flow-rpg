# GM Guidelines: [Content Category]

<!-- Replace [Content Category] with your category name -->

This section helps Game Masters work with [content category] at their table.

## Helping Players Choose

When players are selecting their [content item]:

1. **Ask about fantasy** - What kind of character do they imagine?
2. **Discuss playstyle** - Do they prefer combat, social, exploration?
3. **Consider the party** - What roles are covered? What gaps exist?
4. **Embrace overlap** - Two similar [content items] can work together!

## Running [Content Category] in Play

### Spotlight Moments

Each [content item] should have opportunities to shine. Plan scenes that highlight:

- **[Item 1]** - [What situations showcase this option?]
- **[Item 2]** - [What situations showcase this option?]
- **[Item 3]** - [What situations showcase this option?]

### Common Challenges

**Player feels overshadowed:**
- Create varied challenges that reward different strengths
- Offer personal story hooks tied to their [content item]
- Ensure NPCs react to their unique qualities

**[Content item] seems too strong/weak:**
- Discuss with the player about their experience
- Consider if challenges favor certain [content items]
- Adjust target numbers for specific situations if needed

## Balance Considerations

[Note any balance concerns or edge cases GMs should be aware of]

## Customization Options

Players may want to customize their [content item]. Consider:

- **Reflavoring** - Same mechanics, different description
- **Minor tweaks** - Swap one ability for a similar one
- **Hybrid builds** - If your system supports multiclassing

*Always discuss customization before the game, not mid-session.*
