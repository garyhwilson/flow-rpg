# [Your TTRPG System] - Living Design Document

*Last Updated: [Date]*

This document tracks ongoing design decisions, outstanding issues, and development priorities. It serves as a continuity reference between development sessions and should be regularly updated and pruned as items are addressed.

**Technical Reference**: For system architecture, TTRPG design philosophy, and workflow commands, see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Current Project Status

<!-- Update these as you complete major milestones -->

- **Core Rules**: [ ] Define basic mechanics
- **Character Creation**: [ ] Species/ancestry options
- **Classes/Archetypes**: [ ] Define character paths
- **Equipment**: [ ] Weapons, armor, gear
- **Magic/Abilities**: [ ] Special powers system
- **Adversaries/NPCs**: [ ] Opposition for adventures
- **Publication System**: [ ] Manifests for book assembly
- **Playtesting**: [ ] Balance validation

## Active Development Priorities

<!-- List your current focus areas. Examples: -->

### 1. Core Mechanics Definition

- [ ] Define dice mechanic (d20, 2d6, dice pool, etc.)
- [ ] Establish attribute system
- [ ] Define skill/ability framework
- [ ] Set target number or difficulty system

### 2. Character Creation Framework

- [ ] Design species/ancestry options
- [ ] Create class/archetype structure
- [ ] Define starting character build process

### 3. Combat System

- [ ] Action economy
- [ ] Health/damage tracking
- [ ] Special maneuvers and tactics

## Outstanding Design Issues

<!-- Track problems that need resolution. Format:
- **Issue Name**: Brief description
  - _Potential Solution_: How you might fix it
  - _Status_: Not started / In progress / Needs playtesting
-->

### Balance Concerns

*Add balance issues as they arise during playtesting.*

### Missing Subsystems

Critical gameplay systems not yet documented:

- **[Subsystem Name]**: Description of what's needed
  - _Status_: Not started
  - _Priority_: High/Medium/Low

### System Integration Questions

*Track questions about how different parts of your system interact.*

## Recently Addressed Items

<!-- Move completed items here with date and brief resolution notes -->

### [Date] - Item Name
- What was fixed/resolved
- Any notes for future reference

## Design Principles

<!-- Define your game's core design philosophy -->

1. **[Principle 1]**: Explanation
2. **[Principle 2]**: Explanation
3. **[Principle 3]**: Explanation

## Critical Constraints

<!-- List any "do not change" rules that emerged from playtesting -->

*Add critical balance constraints as they are discovered through playtesting.*

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Development Session

1. Read this document for context
2. Check current priorities
3. Review any outstanding issues relevant to today's work

### During Development

1. Update todos as you complete tasks
2. Note any new issues discovered
3. Document design decisions and rationale

### Ending a Development Session

1. Update this document with progress
2. Move completed items to "Recently Addressed"
3. Add any new issues to tracking
4. Update "Last Updated" date

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format

```
[type]: Brief description

Longer explanation if needed.

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Keep each point focused
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, balance, playtest

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable, tested content
- `feature/*` - New systems or major additions
- `playtest/*` - Balance testing branches

## Notes

<!-- Scratch space for ideas, random thoughts, things to remember -->
