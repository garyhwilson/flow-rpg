# Introduction to Game Mastering


Welcome, Game Master! This guide provides everything you need to run compelling Flow RPG adventures.

# PLAYING THE GAME

## Core Gameplay Loop

The game follows a consistent structure that balances player agency with GM guidance:

1. **GM Sets the Scene:** Describes environment, NPCs, and situation
2. **Players Declare Actions:** State what their characters attempt to do
3. **GM Determines Approach:** Assigns appropriate Attribute + Skill combination
4. **Players Roll Dice:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill vs target difficulty (typically 8)
5. **GM Narrates Results:** Describes outcome based on success level
6. **Flow Adjusts:** Players gain or lose Flow based on results
7. **Narrative Progresses:** Scene evolves based on character actions

This cycle repeats throughout gameplay, maintaining a balance between mechanical resolution and narrative development.

---

## Scenes & Encounters

### Scene Types

The game features four primary scene types, each with distinct pacing and focus:

#### Action Scenes
- Combat encounters, chases, time-pressure situations
- Turn-by-turn structure with stance-based initiative
- Heavy Flow generation and expenditure
- Typically last 3-5 rounds of combat

#### Social Scenes
- Negotiations, interrogations, persuasion attempts
- Can use structured social combat or freeform roleplay
- Focus on character motivations and relationships
- Flow generation through successful social maneuvers

#### Exploration Scenes
- Investigating locations, solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles
- Skill checks to discover information and overcome challenges
- Flow generation through successful discoveries
- Environmental hazards and challenges

#### Downtime Scenes
- Rest, recovery, research, and personal projects
- Opportunity for character development
- Preparation for upcoming challenges
- Flow resets to 0 after extended rest

### Scene Transitions

The GM indicates transitions between scene types by:

- **Setting Stakes:** "The guards spot you - what do you do?"
- **Changing Pace:** "As the dust settles from battle..."
- **Environmental Shift:** "The narrow passage opens into a vast chamber..."
- **Temporal Shift:** "After resting for the night..."

### Scene Resolution

A scene typically concludes when:
- The primary challenge is overcome
- The party achieves their immediate objective
- The situation fundamentally changes
- The party retreats or changes course

---

## Skill Challenge Framework

Complex tasks that require multiple successful checks can be structured as skill challenges:

### Designing Skill Challenges

1. **Define Objective:** What players are trying to accomplish
2. **Set Complexity:** Number of successful checks needed (typically 3-5)
3. **Identify Key Skills:** Primary skills that apply to the challenge
4. **Establish Consequences:** What happens on success/failure
5. **Allow Creative Approaches:** Different skill/attribute combinations

### Running Skill Challenges

- Players describe approach and make appropriate checks
- Each player should contribute different skills
- Success/failure advances narrative in different ways
- Flow can be spent to enhance rolls
- Critical successes count as two successes

### Example Skill Challenge: Mountain Crossing

**Objective:** Cross treacherous mountain pass during a storm
**Complexity:** 4 successes before 3 failures
**Key Skills:** Athletics, Survival, Investigate
**Consequences:** Success = safe passage, Failure = dangerous detour
**Approaches:**
- Athletics (Might) to climb difficult sections
- Survival (Awareness) to find sheltered paths
- Investigate (Mind) to predict avalanche zones
- Command (Presence) to keep party motivated
- Medicine (Mind) to treat cold injuries

---

## Environmental Challenges

- Modifies social interaction checks
- Determines NPC reactions and assistance
- Changes based on character actions and social checks

**Building Relationships:**
- Successful social checks improve relationship score
- Gifts, favors, and assistance provide bonuses
- Shared experiences create stronger bonds
- Calling abilities can enhance relationship building

### Social Flow

Flow can be generated and spent during social interactions:

**Generating Social Flow:**

### Social Stances

As in combat, characters can adopt different stances during social interactions:

**Aggressive (Social)**
- Direct, confrontational approach
- Effective for intimidation and challenges
- Generates Flow on successful pressure
- Risks relationship damage on failure

**Balanced (Social)**
- Measured, diplomatic approach
- Good for negotiations and compromises
- Adapts to changing social dynamics
- Safe but not always impactful

**Defensive (Social)**
- Cautious, reserved approach
- Focused on gathering information
- Reveals little about oneself
- Generates Flow when learning secrets

### Group Interactions

When interacting with multiple NPCs:

- Primary NPC serves as group representative
- Supporting NPCs can be influenced separately
- Group dynamics affect difficulty of checks
- Flow can be spent to affect multiple NPCs at once

---

## Rest & Recovery

### Short Rest (1 Hour)

A brief period of downtime that allows:
- Restore all Guard
- Spend 1 Flow to recover 1 Vitality (once per short rest)
- Maintain concentration on long-duration effects
- Perform quick maintenance and preparation

### Long Rest (8 Hours)

An extended period of recovery that provides:
- Restore all Guard and 1d6 Vitality

- Recover from most temporary conditions
- Prepare for next day's challenges

### Extended Rest (1+ Days)

Significant downtime in a safe location:
- Restore all Guard and Vitality
- Reset Flow to 0
- Recover from serious injuries and conditions
- Opportunity for research, crafting, and personal projects
- Typically available between adventures

### Injury & Recovery

Serious injuries (from critical hits or special circumstances) might:
- Impose penalties until properly treated
- Require Medicine checks to stabilize
- Need extended rest to fully recover
- Create narrative opportunities for character development
- Sometimes leave permanent scars or effects

---

## Running the Game

### GM Principles

Effective Game Masters follow these core principles:

**Narrative First, Rules Second**
- Use rules to support the story, not restrict it
- When in doubt, choose the more interesting outcome
- Let player creativity flourish

**Fair But Challenging**
- Provide obstacles that test characters' abilities
- Scale challenges to character capabilities
- Allow both success and failure to be interesting

**Flow Management**
- Monitor the Flow economy to ensure balance
- Provide opportunities to gain and spend Flow
- Use Flow as pacing mechanism for scenes

**Collaborative Storytelling**
- Incorporate player ideas and backstories
- Build on player actions to develop the narrative
- Share narrative control where appropriate

### Creating Adventures

A well-designed adventure typically includes:

**Hook & Motivation**
- Clear reason for character involvement
- Stakes that matter to the characters
- Connection to character backstories or goals

**Varied Challenges**
- Mix of combat, social, and exploration scenes
- Challenges that highlight different character abilities
- Multiple valid approaches to solutions

**Meaningful Choices**
- Decision points with significant consequences
- Opportunity for different strategies
- No single "correct" path through the adventure

**Rewards & Development**
- Appropriate treasure, information, or resources
- Opportunities for character growth
- Seeds for future adventures

### Adapting to Player Choices

When players take unexpected actions:

1. **Consider the Logic:** Does their approach make sense in the world?
2. **Determine Difficulty:** Set appropriate target numbers
3. **Identify Consequences:** What happens on success or failure?
4. **Integrate into Narrative:** How does this change the story?
5. **Move Forward:** Adapt the adventure to accommodate their choice

### Pacing Guidelines

Maintain engaging pacing with these techniques:

**Session Structure**
- Begin with a recap and character moment
- Build toward a significant scene or revelation
- End with a satisfying conclusion or compelling cliffhanger

**Scene Transitions**
- Recognize when a scene has accomplished its purpose
- Use "meanwhile" cuts to maintain momentum
- Vary pacing between tense and relaxed scenes

**Time Management**
- Allocate time based on importance, not just challenge
- Handwave routine or repetitive actions
- Give more time to character-defining moments

---

## Advanced Gameplay Elements

### Group Checks

When the entire party attempts the same action:
- Everyone makes the appropriate check
- Success requires at least half the group to succeed
- Critical successes can offset failures
- Flow can be spent to help struggling party members

### Opposed Checks

When characters directly compete:
- Both sides make appropriate checks
- Higher result wins (ties favor defenders)
- Margin of success determines outcome degree
- Flow can be spent after seeing opponent's roll

### Helping & Hindering

Characters can assist or interfere with others:
- **Help:** Make same check, success gives +1d6 to primary character
- **Hinder:** Make opposed check, success gives -1d6 to target
- Limit of one help/hinder per action
- Requires logical explanation of assistance method

### Secret Checks

Some checks are made by the GM:
- When character wouldn't know if they succeeded
- When information should be uncertain
- When metagaming concerns exist
- Examples: Stealth, certain Investigate checks, some social insights

- Combined Flow benefits

---

## Narrative Permissions

### Using Narrative Permissions

Callings grant special abilities that bypass normal rules:

**Permission Types**
- Information acquisition
- Social insight
- Combat advantage
- Environmental interaction

**Implementation Guidelines**
- Permissions override normal skill checks
- No roll needed for permitted actions
- Cannot be countered by normal means
- Creates unique character moments

**Permission Limitations**
- Once per scene for most permissions
- Must align with Calling's core drive
- Cannot completely bypass major plot points
- May have subtle consequences for overuse

### Narrative Permission Examples

**Truth Sense (Advocate)**
- Automatically know when someone lies about wrongdoing
- GM provides truthful information without roll
- Creates opportunity for character to expose truth
- Does not reveal the whole truth, just dishonesty

**Danger Sense (Sentinel)**
- Cannot be surprised or ambushed
- Always act in first round of combat
- Does not reveal nature of threat, just its presence
- Still vulnerable if unable to respond

**Soul Reading (Seeker)**
- Force honest answer to personal question
- Target may be cryptic but cannot lie
- Creates deep character interaction
- Once per scene limit prevents interrogation abuse

**Victory Sense (Exemplar)**
- Know what constitutes success in any situation
- Does not reveal how to succeed, just what success looks like
- Guides character's approach to challenges
- Provides clarity but not advantage





# Part I: Mastering the Systems


Deep dives into running each system effectively, with balance considerations and practical advice.


## Running Callings

# GM Guidelines for Callings

## Calling Benefits in Action

### Adjudicating Flow Benefits
- **Require authentic motivation** - actions must genuinely align with the Calling
- **Scene limits prevent abuse** - most are once per scene
- **Let players invoke them** - but verify the connection to their Calling
- **Reward creative applications** that stay true to character
- **Stack with other sources** - Calling benefits add to normal Flow generation

When determining if a Flow Benefit triggers, ask:
1. Does this action genuinely express the character's Calling?
2. Has this benefit already been used this scene (if limited)?
3. Does this create an interesting narrative moment?

If the answer to these questions is "yes," allow the benefit to trigger.

#### Example Adjudication

**Good Trigger:** The Guardian rushes into danger to shield innocents from an avalanche. This clearly expresses their core drive to help others, puts them at personal risk, and creates a dramatic moment.

**Questionable Trigger:** The Guardian heals a wealthy merchant who offered them a large reward. While technically "helping," this doesn't express their core drive authentically - it's motivated by self-interest rather than genuine care.

**Poor Trigger:** The Guardian attempts to retroactively claim they were "helping" by attacking a foe, simply to gain the Flow benefit. Combat actions need to specifically express protection or service to qualify.

### Managing Narrative Permissions
- **Say yes when possible** - these define what makes characters special
- **Provide useful information** - make permissions feel valuable
- **Don't let them bypass everything** - major mysteries remain mysterious
- **Use them for worldbuilding** - what characters notice reveals the world
- **Enhance scenes** - permissions create unique character moments

When a player invokes a Narrative Permission, consider:
1. What interesting information can this reveal?
2. How can this move the story forward?
3. What limitations might apply in this situation?

Always provide something of value when a Narrative Permission is used, even if it can't completely solve the problem at hand.

#### Example Permission Use

**Strong Use:** The Seeker asks the captured cultist, "What do you truly fear about the ritual you're performing?" The cultist must answer honestly, revealing their secret fear that the summoned entity will consume them first.

**Creative Use:** The Enthusiast's Silver Lining permission reveals that the collapsing tunnel has created vibrations that are attracting cave worms - creatures that might be followed to another exit.

**Limited Use:** The Advocate's Truth Sense detects that the king is lying about corruption, but cannot reveal the specific details of the truth - only that deception is occurring.

## NPCs and Callings

Major NPCs should have clear Callings that inform their motivations and actions. This creates more consistent, believable characters and helps players understand their perspective.

### Implementing NPC Callings
- Give major NPCs one clear Calling that drives their actions
- Allow their Calling to influence their decision-making
- Use their Calling to determine their approach to problems
- Consider both healthy and unhealthy expressions of their Calling

### Villain Callings
Villains with well-defined Callings create more compelling antagonists:

- **Advocate Villain:** A zealot who believes their harsh "justice" is necessary purification
- **Guardian Villain:** A controlling figure who believes others cannot survive without them
- **Exemplar Villain:** An ambitious leader who sacrifices others for their success
- **Scholar Villain:** An obsessive researcher who ignores ethical boundaries in pursuit of knowledge
- **Champion Villain:** A tyrant who believes might makes right and force justifies control

### Calling-Based NPC Reactions

NPCs react differently to the same situation based on their Calling:

**Scenario: A village needs protection from bandits**

- **Advocate NPC:** Organizes a militia to establish justice
- **Guardian NPC:** Personally takes responsibility for protecting the vulnerable
- **Exemplar NPC:** Sees it as an opportunity to prove their worth and gain recognition
- **Seeker NPC:** Uses the crisis to discover what kind of person they truly are
- **Scholar NPC:** Studies bandit patterns to develop optimal defense strategies
- **Sentinel NPC:** Creates security protocols and prepares contingencies
- **Enthusiast NPC:** Finds excitement in the danger while keeping spirits high
- **Champion NPC:** Takes charge and leads the defense through strength
- **Mediator NPC:** Attempts to negotiate with the bandits while preparing defense

## Moral Complexity

Callings shine when presented with morally complex situations that challenge their core drives. These create rich roleplaying opportunities and character growth.

### Creating Moral Challenges
- Present situations where different Callings suggest different "right" actions
- Avoid making any Calling inherently good or evil
- Show consequences of taking Callings to extremes
- Reward players for authentic character choices
- Create ethical dilemmas that challenge each Calling

### Example Dilemmas by Calling

**Advocate Dilemma:** The corrupt official deserves justice, but punishing them will cause suffering to innocent dependents.

**Guardian Dilemma:** Two people need help simultaneously - helping one means abandoning the other.

**Exemplar Dilemma:** Success in the mission requires sacrificing personal integrity or harming a teammate.

**Seeker Dilemma:** Being true to yourself means breaking from group consensus on an important decision.

**Scholar Dilemma:** The knowledge you seek is dangerous and might be better left undiscovered.

**Sentinel Dilemma:** Your loyalty is demanded by two conflicting authorities.

**Enthusiast Dilemma:** The immediate pleasurable choice threatens long-term happiness.

**Champion Dilemma:** Protecting one group requires abandoning another to their fate.

**Mediator Dilemma:** True peace requires a difficult confrontation rather than compromise.

## Campaign Themes

Different Callings suggest different campaign styles and themes. Consider emphasizing certain themes based on your party's Calling composition.

### Thematic Campaigns

**Justice & Corruption (Advocate/Champion)**
- Political intrigue and moral choices
- Reforming corrupt systems
- Standing against powerful enemies
- Weighing ideals against pragmatic necessities

**Discovery & Secrets (Scholar/Seeker)**
- Ancient mysteries and forgotten knowledge
- Personal journeys of discovery
- Uncovering hidden truths
- Weighing knowledge against safety

**Protection & Community (Guardian/Sentinel)**
- Defending home against threats
- Building and maintaining communities
- Bonds between protectors and protected
- Weighing duty against personal needs

**Achievement & Adventure (Exemplar/Enthusiast)**
- Competitive challenges and contests
- Exploration of uncharted territories
- Fame, fortune, and recognition
- Weighing ambition against cooperation

**Peace & Harmony (Mediator)**
- Diplomacy between warring factions
- Understanding cultural differences
- Finding balance in chaos
- Weighing compromise against principle

### Mixed Calling Party Dynamics

In parties with diverse Callings, emphasize:

- **Complementary approaches** to problems
- **Creative tensions** between different moral perspectives
- **Growth opportunities** as characters influence each other
- **Varied challenges** that give different Callings moments to shine

## Using Callings in World Building

Callings can inform the structure of organizations, cultures, and institutions in your world:

### Organizations by Calling

**Advocate Organizations:**
- Justice systems and courts
- Reform movements
- Quality control guilds
- Religious orthodoxies

**Guardian Organizations:**
- Healing orders and hospitals
- Community service groups
- Protective militias
- Caretaking institutions

**Scholar Organizations:**
- Libraries and universities
- Research institutions
- Historical societies
- Arcane academies

**Champion Organizations:**
- Elite military units
- Ruling dynasties
- Athletic competitions
- Protector orders

**Mediator Organizations:**
- Diplomatic corps
- Counseling services
- Peace-keeping forces
- Cultural exchange programs

Each of these organizations will have distinct approaches, values, and methods shaped by their dominant Calling.



## Running Archetypes

# GM Guidelines for Archetypes

## Balancing Archetypes in Play

### Core Principles
- **Distinct Not Dominant:** Each archetype should excel in their specialty without overshadowing others
- **Overlapping Not Identical:** Allow areas of shared competence while maintaining unique approaches
- **Situational Spotlight:** Create scenarios where each archetype can shine
- **Collaborative Synergy:** Encourage combinations that highlight complementary abilities

### Addressing Common Balance Issues

#### Combat Role Balance
- **Fighters/Paladins/Rangers (Front Line):** Ensure these archetypes have appropriate defensive options but different offensive approaches
- **Rogues/Rangers (Strikers):** Balance burst damage with positioning requirements
- **Wizards/Clerics/Bards (Support):** Ensure utility options remain valuable alongside damage capabilities

#### Skill Coverage
- **High-Skill Archetypes (Rogues/Rangers/Bards):** Challenge them beyond their comfort zones
- **Specialized Archetypes (Fighters/Wizards):** Provide opportunities where depth beats breadth
- **Hybrid Archetypes (Clerics/Paladins):** Create scenarios that reward their versatility

#### Flow Economy
- **High Generation (Fighters/Bards):** Ensure Flow expenditure options remain interesting
- **Efficient Users (Wizards/Rogues):** Make Flow costs meaningful to prevent spamming
- **Consistent Output (Clerics/Paladins):** Provide occasional high-Flow situations to showcase their potential

### Spotlight Distribution
Ensure each archetype receives regular moments of spotlight by incorporating varied challenges:

- **Fighter Spotlight:** Combat mastery, endurance challenges, intimidation opportunities
- **Ranger Spotlight:** Wilderness navigation, tracking, animal interaction
- **Paladin Spotlight:** Leadership moments, conviction tests, protection scenarios
- **Rogue Spotlight:** Infiltration, acquisition, social deception
- **Wizard Spotlight:** Magical analysis, arcane obstacles, knowledge application
- **Cleric Spotlight:** Healing crises, spiritual challenges, community service
- **Bard Spotlight:** Social influence, performance opportunities, lore utilization

## Archetype Integration in Worldbuilding

### Archetype Organizations
Incorporate archetype-specific organizations to enrich your setting:

- **Fighter Guilds:** Martial training halls, mercenary companies, elite guards
- **Ranger Enclaves:** Wilderness outposts, border wardens, nature preserves
- **Paladin Orders:** Sacred knighthoods, divine champions, oath fellowships
- **Rogue Networks:** Thieves' guilds, spy rings, artisan collectives
- **Wizard Academies:** Arcane universities, research councils, spell libraries
- **Clerical Hierarchies:** Temple organizations, healing orders, missionary groups
- **Bardic Colleges:** Performance troupes, lore keepers, diplomatic services

### Cultural Variations
Diversify archetypes across cultures to create rich setting details:

- **Regional Approaches:** How different regions adapt archetypes to local conditions
- **Species Adaptations:** How different species modify archetypal training
- **Historical Evolution:** How archetypes have changed through historical events
- **Resource Adaptation:** How archetypes adjust to available materials

### Status and Recognition
Consider how different societies view each archetype:

- **Honored Professions:** Archetypes that receive respect and authority
- **Necessary Outsiders:** Archetypes that are needed but viewed with suspicion
- **Hidden Practitioners:** Archetypes that operate covertly in certain regions
- **Competing Traditions:** Different approaches to the same archetype in conflict

## Archetype Development Through Campaign

### Milestone Integration
Use milestones to facilitate meaningful archetype development:

- **Minor Milestones:** Refinement of existing archetype techniques
- **Moderate Milestones:** Integration of new approaches within archetype framework
- **Major Milestones:** Potential hybrid development or specialization options

### Creating Growth Opportunities
Design scenarios that push characters to develop their archetypal capabilities:

- **Mentorship Encounters:** NPCs who can teach advanced techniques
- **Crucible Challenges:** Situations that force innovation within archetype traditions
- **Legacy Discoveries:** Ancient knowledge that expands archetypal understanding
- **Cross-Training Opportunities:** Exposure to related archetypes for potential hybrid growth

### Multi-Archetype Integration
Support characters who wish to incorporate elements of multiple archetypes:

- **Natural Combinations:** Fighter/Ranger, Wizard/Cleric, Rogue/Bard
- **Challenging Combinations:** Fighter/Wizard, Cleric/Rogue, Paladin/Bard
- **Training Requirements:** What's needed to justify technique acquisition
- **Specialization vs. Versatility:** Trade-offs in development focus

## Implementing Archetypes in Adventures

### Encounter Design for Archetype Diversity
Create encounters that engage different archetypes:

- **Multi-Stage Challenges:** Combat followed by obstacle followed by social challenge
- **Environment Integration:** Combat arenas with features relevant to multiple archetypes
- **Objective Variety:** Goals beyond "defeat all enemies"
- **Opponent Diversity:** Enemies that challenge different archetypal approaches

### Adventure Hooks by Archetype
Design hooks that specifically engage each archetype's interests:

- **Fighter Hooks:** Tournament invitations, martial challenges, tactical problems
- **Ranger Hooks:** Wilderness anomalies, tracking assignments, animal threats
- **Paladin Hooks:** Oath fulfillment, protection requests, corruption evidence
- **Rogue Hooks:** Heist opportunities, information acquisition, underworld tensions
- **Wizard Hooks:** Magical anomalies, arcane research, spell discoveries
- **Cleric Hooks:** Divine visions, community needs, temple responsibilities
- **Bard Hooks:** Performance opportunities, story collection, diplomatic missions

### NPC Archetypes
Use NPCs to showcase different expressions of each archetype:

- **Mentors:** Experienced practitioners who can guide PCs
- **Rivals:** Same-archetype competitors with different approaches
- **Innovators:** NPCs pushing archetypal boundaries
- **Traditionalists:** NPCs representing orthodox approaches
- **Counterparts:** NPCs with complementary archetype specializations

## Troubleshooting Common Archetype Issues

### Overshadowing
When one archetype consistently outperforms others:

- **Diagnosis:** Identify whether the issue is system imbalance, scenario design, or player skill
- **System Adjustment:** Consider tweaking Flow costs or technique effects if system-related
- **Scenario Balance:** Incorporate more varied challenges to engage other archetypes
- **Player Guidance:** Encourage spotlight sharing and collaborative approaches

### Underperformance
When a player feels their archetype isn't effective:

- **Technique Review:** Ensure the player understands their full range of options
- **Equipment Opportunities:** Provide gear that enhances their archetypal strengths
- **Skill Application:** Suggest creative uses of their archetype abilities
- **Spotlight Design:** Deliberately create scenarios where they can excel

### Repetitive Play
When archetype abilities become predictable:

- **Scenario Variety:** Change the context in which abilities are used
- **NPC Evolution:** Have opponents adapt to predictable tactics
- **Environmental Challenges:** Create situations where standard approaches must be modified
- **Reward Innovation:** Provide Flow bonuses for creative technique application

### Development Constraints
When players feel limited by archetype frameworks:

- **Training Narratives:** Create in-story opportunities to learn new approaches
- **Technique Adaptation:** Allow reskinning of techniques to fit character concepts
- **Hybrid Development:** Support thoughtful integration of multiple archetypal elements
- **Unique Techniques:** Work with players to develop signature abilities that reflect their character's unique approach

## Running Archetype-Focused Sessions

Occasionally spotlight specific archetypes with focused sessions:

### Fighter Focus
- **Tournament Arc:** Competitive combat showcasing martial prowess
- **Military Campaign:** Strategic warfare utilizing tactical expertise
- **Combat School:** Training sequences developing new techniques

### Ranger Focus

- **Tracking Mission:** Following elusive quarry through challenging terrain
- **Beast Management:** Handling dangerous creature threats or migrations

### Paladin Focus
- **Oath Quest:** Fulfilling the requirements of divine commitment
- **Protection Detail:** Safeguarding important individuals or artifacts
- **Corruption Cleansing:** Confronting systemic evil requiring conviction

### Rogue Focus
- **Heist Operation:** Complex acquisition requiring multiple specialized skills
- **Underworld Politics:** Navigating criminal organizations and power structures
- **Infiltration Mission:** Gaining access to heavily secured locations

### Wizard Focus
- **Arcane Investigation:** Solving mysteries through magical analysis
- **Research Expedition:** Seeking rare magical knowledge or components
- **Spell Innovation:** Developing new magical techniques through experimentation

### Cleric Focus
- **Divine Intervention:** Responding to spiritual crisis requiring faith
- **Healing Emergency:** Managing widespread injury or disease
- **Religious Diplomacy:** Mediating between different faith traditions

### Bard Focus
- **Performance Circuit:** Competition or tour showcasing artistic talents
- **Lore Collection:** Gathering stories with historical or magical significance
- **Diplomatic Mission:** Using social skills to negotiate complex agreements

Remember that archetype-focused sessions should still provide meaningful roles for other characters—they simply place one archetype's capabilities at the narrative center.



## Running Species

# Species GM Guidelines
*Advice for Game Masters on Integrating Species into Campaigns*

## Introduction

As a Game Master, the species system in Flow RPG offers you rich opportunities for worldbuilding, character development, and thematic exploration. This guide provides strategies for incorporating species diversity into your game world, balancing cultural representation with individual character agency, and handling common challenges that may arise during play.

## Worldbuilding with Species

### Cultural Expression vs. Biological Determinism

When developing your game world, it's important to distinguish between biological traits common to a species and cultural practices that vary between different communities within that species:

**Biological Constants:** Certain traits remain consistent across all members of a species regardless of cultural context. These include basic physical characteristics (lifespan, sensory capabilities, physical needs) and innate tendencies (elven connection to natural cycles, dwarven resilience, etc.).

**Cultural Variables:** Many aspects traditionally associated with species represent specific cultural expressions rather than biological imperatives. These include language preferences, artistic styles, governance structures, and religious practices, which may vary significantly between different communities of the same species.

When describing species in your world, clearly distinguish which elements are biological constants and which represent cultural patterns that may have exceptions or regional variations. This approach creates a richer world while allowing players greater flexibility in character development.

### Historical Development

Consider how the different species in your world have interacted historically, as these patterns significantly impact contemporary relationships:

**Migration Patterns:** How have different species moved through the world over time? Did they originate in separate regions and later come into contact, or have they always shared territories? These patterns shape current distribution and intercultural dynamics.

**Resource Competition:** What resources have different species traditionally valued and sought to control? Where these priorities differ (elves valuing ancient forests while dwarves prize the minerals beneath), coexistence becomes easier. Where they align, historical conflicts often emerge.

**Knowledge Exchange:** How have different species influenced each other's development through knowledge sharing? Consider how longer-lived species might preserve historical knowledge, while more adaptable species might develop innovative techniques that spread across cultural boundaries.

**Conflict Resolution:** What mechanisms have developed to address tensions between species? These might include formal treaties, interspecies councils, designated neutral territories, or cultural practices facilitating peaceful interaction despite differences.

### Contemporary Dynamics

Beyond historical context, consider how species interact in the current era of your campaign:

**Integration vs. Separation:** Do different species typically live in integrated communities or maintain separate settlements? This fundamental pattern shapes everything from language development to architectural styles and social customs.

**Power Structures:** How do governance systems accommodate or fail to address species differences? Consider whether political structures represent all species equally, favor certain groups, or maintain separate systems with diplomatic interfaces.

**Economic Relationships:** What specialized goods or services do different species typically provide within the broader economy? These patterns create both interdependence and potential tensions when resources become scarce or demand patterns shift.

**Cultural Exchange:** How do ideas, technologies, and practices flow between species? Consider both formal knowledge transmission systems (interspecies schools, apprenticeships) and informal cultural borrowing that occurs through regular contact.

## Character Integration

### Species as Context, Not Destiny

When helping players develop characters, emphasize that species provides context rather than determining personality or values:

**Individual Variation:** Every species encompasses individuals with diverse personalities, values, and approaches to life. A character might embrace their cultural heritage, reject certain aspects while maintaining others, or develop a personal philosophy drawing from multiple cultural traditions.

**Cultural Exposure:** Consider how a character's upbringing might differ from species stereotypes due to their specific community, family circumstances, or personal experiences. A dwarf raised in a human city or an elf who spent formative years among halflings will develop perspectives that blend different cultural influences.

**Conscious Relationship:** Encourage players to consider their character's conscious relationship with their heritage—do they embrace traditional values, deliberately reject certain aspects, or remain unaware of how cultural conditioning shapes their worldview? These choices create depth beyond simple adherence to species traits.

### Mixed Communities

Many compelling character concepts emerge from mixed-species environments:

**Border Settlements:** Communities situated between traditional territories often develop unique hybrid cultures incorporating elements from multiple species, creating characters with complex cultural identities that transcend simple categorization.

**Urban Centers:** Larger cities typically attract individuals from various species, creating cosmopolitan environments where cultural exchange, specialized districts, and intercultural tension all provide rich roleplaying opportunities.

**Trade Hubs:** Settlements focused on commerce often develop pragmatic approaches to species differences, creating environments where practical concerns override traditional divisions and innovative hybrid approaches readily emerge.

**Educational Institutions:** Schools, universities, and training centers that accept students from diverse backgrounds create unique opportunities for characters to develop perspectives informed by multiple cultural traditions.

### Species-Specific Motivations

Different species often approach similar goals with distinctive motivations shaped by their cultural values and biological nature:

**Humans** typically pursue goals with intensity and innovation, seeking to accomplish objectives within their limited lifespans through creative approaches and rapid adaptation.

**Elves** often approach the same objectives with patience and systemic thinking, considering long-term consequences and seeking sustainable solutions that will remain viable for centuries.

**Dwarves** frequently emphasize thoroughness and tradition, drawing on accumulated knowledge and proven methodologies while building upon foundations established by ancestors.

**Halflings** commonly focus on practical outcomes and community impact, prioritizing approaches that maintain social bonds and improve quality of life over abstract principles or individual achievement.

These distinctive motivations create depth when characters from different species pursue shared goals through complementary approaches.

## Handling Common Challenges

### Avoiding Stereotypes

While species in Flow RPG represent genuinely different biological beings with distinctive cultures, it's important to avoid reducing individual characters to simplistic stereotypes:

**Complex Societies:** Present each species as having diverse and complex societies containing internal disagreement, regional variation, and evolutionary change rather than monolithic cultures with uniform values.

**Individual Agency:** Emphasize that individuals make choices about which aspects of their cultural heritage to embrace or reject, creating personal identities that relate to but aren't determined by their species' typical patterns.

**Cultural Context:** When describing species-typical behaviors, frame them as adaptations to specific environmental, historical, or social circumstances rather than inherent moral qualities or intelligence differences.

**Character Development:** Allow characters to grow beyond initial cultural limitations through experience and reflection, demonstrating that individuals can transcend limitations of perspective through deliberate effort and exposure to diverse viewpoints.

### Handling Interspecies Tension

Many compelling stories emerge from tensions between different species, but these narratives require careful handling:

**Specific Rather Than General:** Focus conflicts on specific historical events, resource competitions, or cultural misunderstandings rather than innate incompatibility or generalized prejudice. This approach creates space for resolution through understanding and compromise.

**Complex Motivations:** Present all sides of interspecies conflicts as having comprehensible motivations rooted in different values, needs, or historical experiences rather than portraying any group as inherently aggressive or unreasonable.

**Individual Exceptions:** Include characters who transcend typical tensions, forming friendships and alliances across species boundaries that demonstrate the possibility of mutual understanding and cooperation despite differences.

**Growth Opportunities:** Use interspecies tensions as opportunities for character development as individuals confront their preconceptions, develop empathy for different perspectives, and find common ground despite cultural differences.

### Balancing Spotlight Time

Different species naturally excel in different situations, creating potential imbalance in character spotlight time:

**Diverse Challenges:** Design adventures that include varied challenges playing to different species' strengths, ensuring each character has opportunities to leverage their natural advantages.

**Unexpected Applications:** Create situations where species traits provide unexpected advantages beyond their obvious applications, allowing creative players to find novel uses for their innate abilities.

**Compensating Mechanics:** Remember that the Flow system allows characters to overcome natural limitations by spending Flow, enabling characters to succeed even in challenging situations by leveraging the game's resource economy.

**Narrative Contributions:** Encourage contributions beyond mechanical advantages by inviting players to share their character's cultural perspective on situations, providing insight that enriches the group's understanding regardless of who takes the primary action.

## Species-Specific Advice

### Humans

**Showcasing Diversity:** Humans represent the most internally diverse species, with greater cultural variation than other groups. Present human communities with distinctly different values, governance systems, and cultural practices rather than a homogeneous "human culture."

**Temporal Perspective:** Emphasize the human relationship with time by creating scenarios where their shorter lifespan shapes their approach—situations requiring rapid adaptation, compressed learning curves, or decisions with consequences beyond individual lifespans.

**Innovative Approaches:** Create opportunities for human characters to demonstrate their innovative tendencies by presenting novel challenges without established solutions, rewarding creative approaches and experimental techniques.

### Elves

**Beyond Stereotypes:** Avoid reducing elves to simplistic "forest dwellers" by presenting diverse elven cultures including urban communities, academic traditions, and innovative subcultures challenging traditional practices.

**Temporal Disconnect:** Create moments highlighting the elven experience of time through interactions with short-lived species, historical knowledge, or perspectives considering century-long patterns invisible to others.

**Environmental Connection:** Offer opportunities for elven characters to demonstrate their natural attunement by perceiving subtle environmental changes, identifying natural patterns, or sensing disturbances in ecological systems.

### Dwarves

**Cultural Depth:** Present dwarven culture beyond mining stereotypes by exploring their artistic traditions, governance systems, philosophical approaches, and diverse crafting disciplines.

**Ancestral Connection:** Create moments highlighting the dwarven relationship with lineage through family obligations, ancestral knowledge, hereditary responsibilities, or connections to historical events through genealogical memory.

**Resilience in Action:** Offer opportunities for dwarven characters to demonstrate their legendary endurance through challenges requiring sustained effort, resistance to adversity, or maintenance of tradition despite pressures to change.

### Halflings

**Beyond Comfort:** While halflings value comfort, avoid reducing them to simplistic "comfort-seekers" by exploring their pragmatic problem-solving, community-building capabilities, and resilience in adverse circumstances.

**Social Navigation:** Create situations showcasing the halfling aptitude for social dynamics through community mediation, diplomatic challenges, or scenarios requiring coalition-building across different groups.

**Practical Innovation:** Offer opportunities for halfling characters to demonstrate their practical creativity by improvising solutions using available resources, adapting existing tools for new purposes, or finding simple approaches to complex problems.

## Conclusion

The species system in Flow RPG provides rich foundations for worldbuilding, character development, and thematic exploration when handled with nuance and creativity. By presenting species as complex biological and cultural entities with internal diversity while maintaining their distinctive essence, you create a world where both species differences and individual character choices meaningfully impact the narrative.

Remember that species in Flow are designed to create qualitatively different experiences rather than simply providing mechanical advantages. When integrated thoughtfully into your campaign, these differences enrich the storytelling experience by offering diverse perspectives on shared challenges and creating natural complementary relationships between characters.




## Running Magic

# SPELLS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Magic in Your Game

Magic in Flow RPG is designed to be both mechanically elegant and narratively rich. This guide helps you leverage the flexible casting system to create memorable magical moments while maintaining balance and pacing.

## Interpreting Attribute-Based Casting

### Encouraging Player Creativity

The four-attribute casting system gives players tremendous creative freedom. As GM, your role is to:

1. **Honor the Narrative** - Let players describe HOW they're casting with their chosen attribute
2. **Enforce the Mechanics** - Apply the mechanical benefits consistently
3. **Celebrate Variety** - Encourage players to switch attributes based on situations
4. **Maintain Balance** - Don't let one attribute dominate all situations

### Example Rulings

**Player:** "I want to cast Bolt with Presence to intimidate the bandit leader."
**GM Response:** "Great! The bolt will do Presence + d6 damage, and if you hit, the spectacular display will cause fear. Roll for the attack, and we'll see how the bandits react to your show of force."

**Player:** "Can I cast Heal with Mind to diagnose what's wrong with the poisoned merchant?"
**GM Response:** "Absolutely. You'll restore Mind + d6 Vitality, and your analytical approach will let you identify the specific poison. This might give you advantage on finding an antidote."

### When to Say No

Sometimes a player's interpretation doesn't fit the attribute benefits. Guide them gently:

**Player:** "I cast Fireball with Mind and want it to do maximum damage."
**GM:** "Mind gives you precision and control—you can exclude allies from the blast. If you want maximum damage, that's the Awareness approach. Which would you prefer?"

## Balancing Magic in Combat

### Flow Economy Management

Magic is balanced through the Flow economy. As GM, you can:

1. **Control Starting Flow** - Tougher encounters might start with characters at lower Flow
2. **Manage Enemy Actions** - Enemies that generate opponent Flow can limit spellcasting
3. **Vary Encounter Length** - Longer fights strain spellcaster resources
4. **Create Anti-Magic Zones** - Areas where casting is difficult or impossible

### Spellcaster-Heavy Parties

If your party has multiple spellcasters:

- Design encounters that reward different casting approaches
- Include enemies with high Guard (favoring Mind's precision) and low Guard (favoring Awareness's damage)
- Create social encounters where Presence casting shines
- Include situations where Will casting's reliability becomes crucial

### Non-Spellcaster Balance

Ensure martial characters remain relevant:

- Magic costs Flow, weapon attacks often generate it
- Positioning and zone control matter more than pure damage
- Some enemies resist magic but are vulnerable to physical attacks
- Martial characters are more consistent turn-to-turn

## Magical Traditions in Your World

### Using the Four Traditions

The spell system includes four cultural traditions (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md)):

1. **Arcane Academies** (Mind)
2. **Wild Talent** (Awareness)
3. **Divine Channeling** (Will)
4. **Performance Magic** (Presence)

These are narrative frameworks, not mechanical restrictions. Use them to:

- Create faction conflicts (Academy vs. Wild Mages)
- Develop quest hooks (recover stolen holy relic)
- Build setting detail (famous Bard colleges)
- Establish NPC backgrounds

### Custom Traditions

Feel free to create your own magical traditions:

**Example: Blood Magic**
- Primary Attribute: Will or Awareness
- Focus Items: Ritual daggers, blood vials
- Philosophy: Magic powered by life force
- Mechanical Hook: Can spend Vitality instead of Flow for spells

**Example: Rune Magic**
- Primary Attribute: Mind
- Focus Items: Carved stones, inscribed items
- Philosophy: Magic bound into permanent forms
- Mechanical Hook: Prepare spells in advance, cast without roll

Keep custom traditions narratively distinct but mechanically compatible with the core system.

## Handling Edge Cases

### Casting at Negative Flow

Will-based casting allows casting at negative Flow. Guidelines:

1. **It's a Feature, Not a Bug** - This is the Will caster's strength
2. **Narrative Consequences** - Going deeply negative might anger a deity/patron
3. **Recovery Takes Time** - Negative Flow recovers slowly (see [02_system_integration.md](02_system_integration.md))
4. **Physical Toll** - Describe the strain of channeling power when depleted

### Multi-Target Spells

Some spell benefits affect "zones" or "all enemies." Rulings:

1. **Define Zones Clearly** - Use the zone system (Close/Near/Far)
2. **Reasonable Limits** - "All enemies" means those in the affected zone(s)
3. **Mind Precision** - Mind casting can exclude allies from area effects
4. **Narrative Scale** - Describe the awesome scope of large-area spells

### Concentration and Stance Changes

Some spell effects "maintain for scene." Guidelines:

1. **Default Rule** - Effects persist through stance changes unless disruptive
2. **GM Judgment** - Particularly disruptive actions might break concentration
3. **Will Advantage** - Will casting specifically maintains through disruption
4. **Stance Anchors** - Magic items can protect effects (see enchanted items)

## Creating Magical Encounters

### Spellcaster Enemies

When designing enemy spellcasters:

1. **Choose Primary Attribute** - Pick one or two attributes they prefer
2. **Select Appropriate Spells** - Match spell tier to enemy threat level
3. **Consider Flow Economy** - Enemy casters need Flow too
4. **Tactical Behavior** - Show smart casting choices to teach players

**Example: Bandit Wizard**
- Attributes: Mind +2, others +0
- Spells: Bolt (Mind for precision), Shield (Mind for calculated defense)
- Tactics: Stays at Far range, uses Mind to avoid hitting allies
- Flow: Starts at 2-3 Flow, conserves for key moments

**Example: Wild Sorcerer**
- Attributes: Awareness +3, others +0
- Spells: Spark, Bolt, Fireball (all Awareness for maximum damage)
- Tactics: Aggressive, burns Flow quickly for big damage
- Flow: Starts at 4 Flow, goes negative if desperate

### Anti-Magic Challenges

Not every encounter should favor magic. Create variety:

1. **Silence Zones** - Areas where spells can't be cast
2. **Magic-Resistant Enemies** - High bonuses to resist/dodge spells
3. **Counterspelling Foes** - Enemies that can Dispel aggressively
4. **Social Encounters** - Where blasting isn't an option

### Magic-Friendly Scenarios

Sometimes, let spellcasters shine:

1. **Puzzle Encounters** - Where specific spells provide solutions
2. **Investigation Scenes** - Mage Sight and detection spells excel
3. **Mob Combat** - Area spells handle many weak enemies
4. **Dramatic Moments** - Big spell at climactic time

## Enchanted Items and Magic

### Distributing Magical Items

Enchanted items interact with the Flow economy (see [spell_tiers/](spell_tiers/) for item types):

1. **Flow Batteries** - Extend spellcaster staying power
2. **Spell Catalysts** - Make specific spells more efficient
3. **Attribute Enhancers** - Improve casting effectiveness
4. **Stance Anchors** - Provide tactical flexibility

**Balance Guidelines:**
- 1 minor item per character by Milestone 2
- 1 moderate item per character by Milestone 4
- 1 major item per character by Milestone 6
- Legendary items are extremely rare campaign rewards

### Attunement Limits

Characters can attune to items equal to their Will (minimum 1):

- Low Will characters must choose which items to use
- High Will characters can leverage more magical gear
- Creates meaningful choice for martial vs. magical items
- Temporary attunement changes take a full scene

### Creating Custom Magic Items

When designing custom magical items:

1. **Tie to Flow Economy** - Items should interact with Flow
2. **Support Playstyle** - Match items to character approaches
3. **Avoid "Must Haves"** - Don't create items every character needs
4. **Narrative Significance** - Give items history and meaning

**Example Custom Item: Stormcaller's Baton**
- Category: Spell Catalyst
- Effect: Reduce cost of lightning/storm spells by 1 Flow
- Requires: Attunement
- Story: Carved from a tree struck by lightning during a legendary duel

## Adjudicating Spell Effects

### Spell Descriptions as Guidelines

The spell entries provide mechanical frameworks, but:

1. **Allow Creative Applications** - Players will find clever uses
2. **Maintain Mechanical Boundaries** - Don't let spells do everything
3. **Rule Consistently** - Once you allow something, it sets precedent
4. **Discuss Intent** - Understand what players want to accomplish

### The "10-Foot Rule"

If players try to use cantrips to trivialize challenges:

1. **Narrative Limits** - Cantrips are minor magic
2. **Time Constraints** - Some solutions take too long
3. **Imperfect Solutions** - Cantrip fixes are temporary
4. **Encourage Resourcefulness** - But don't shut down creativity

**Example:**
**Player:** "I use Light repeatedly to search the entire dungeon safely."
**GM:** "Light lasts a scene, so you can explore one area at a time. The dungeon is large enough that fully searching it will take days. What's your approach?"

## Common GM Questions

### "Can I limit spells in my game?"

Yes, but carefully:

- Communicate restrictions during Session Zero
- Have narrative justification (magic is illegal, rare, etc.)
- Ensure restrictions apply equally to NPCs
- Consider offering alternative options

### "What if a player only uses one attribute?"

This is fine! It's a valid specialization:

- They'll excel in some situations
- They'll struggle in others
- Other party members will complement them
- They might diversify as they gain milestones

### "How many spells should a character know?"

The system doesn't strictly limit known spells:

- Narrative limits (spellbook size, learned prayers, etc.) are fine
- Consider: All cantrips + 3 spells per tier at creation
- Learn new spells through play (finding scrolls, training, etc.)
- Higher-tier spells are automatically more limited by Flow cost

### "Should I use spell slots instead of Flow?"

The Flow system is core to the game's design:

- Flow creates dynamic pacing
- It unifies magic, combat, and narrative momentum
- Slots would require significant system redesign
- If you prefer slots, consider another system

## Session Zero Discussions

Before starting your campaign, discuss:

1. **Magic Prevalence** - How common is magic in your world?
2. **Tradition Importance** - Do traditions matter mechanically or just narratively?
3. **Item Availability** - How easy is it to find/buy magical items?
4. **House Rules** - Any modifications to spell rules?
5. **Player Expectations** - What kind of magical experience do players want?

---

*Use these guidelines as a framework, not a straightjacket. The best ruling is the one that keeps your game moving, honors the fiction, and ensures everyone has fun.*




## Running Equipment

# Equipment GM Guidelines
*Advice for Game Masters on Integrating Equipment into Campaigns*

## Introduction

As a Game Master, the equipment system in Flow RPG offers rich opportunities for worldbuilding, character development, and tactical challenge design. This guide provides strategies for incorporating equipment meaningfully into your game world, balancing availability with narrative coherence, and handling common equipment-related situations that arise during play.

## Equipment and Worldbuilding

### Regional Availability

Equipment availability provides powerful tools for establishing setting distinctiveness and cultural identity:

**Cultural Specialties**  
Different regions should excel at producing specific equipment types reflecting their resources, traditions, and priorities. A forest kingdom might craft exceptional bows while lacking quality heavy armor, while a mountain realm could produce superior metalwork but struggle with lightweight equipment requiring materials from distant regions.

Consider establishing:
- 2-3 equipment types easily available in each major region
- 1-2 unique regional variants with distinctive properties
- 1-2 equipment types that are rare or inferior in the region

This approach creates distinct equipment "signatures" for different areas without requiring exhaustive cataloging of every possible item.

**Trade Networks**  
Equipment distribution establishes economic connections between regions and clarifies political relationships. Trade routes carrying distinctive weapons, specialized tools, or necessary materials create natural adventure hooks and establish the relative isolation or connectedness of different communities.

Consider developing:
- Major trade hubs specializing in equipment exchange
- Caravans or shipping lanes vulnerable to disruption
- Smuggling networks for restricted or regulated equipment
- Resource dependencies creating political leverage

These patterns transform equipment from mere items on character sheets to dynamic elements integrated with the world's economic and political systems.

**Technological Disparity**  
Varying technological development creates distinctive equipment environments beyond simple quality differences. Some regions might utilize sophisticated composite construction while others rely on simpler but well-refined traditional methods, creating legitimate alternatives rather than clear superiority.

Consider establishing:
- Different technological approaches to similar problems
- Non-linear advancement where some "primitive" cultures excel in specific techniques
- Technology appropriate to environmental challenges rather than abstract "advancement"
- Specialized knowledge protected by guilds, traditions, or political entities

This approach creates interesting equipment variation without implying simplistic cultural hierarchy or inevitable progression patterns.

### Cultural Expression

Equipment serves as powerful visual and practical manifestation of cultural values and priorities:

**Aesthetic Distinctiveness**  
Different cultures express their values through equipment appearance beyond mere decoration. Martial cultures might emphasize intimidating weapon designs, while diplomatically oriented societies could focus on dual-purpose items combining practical function with status display.

Consider developing:
- Distinctive visual signatures for each major culture's equipment
- Design elements reflecting core cultural values
- Contrasting approaches to similar equipment types
- Recognizable patterns allowing equipment origin identification

These visual distinctions create immersive worldbuilding details that reinforce cultural identity through everyday objects.

**Practical Emphasis**  
Equipment priorities reveal what activities cultures value and what challenges they regularly face. A society frequently defending against mounted raiders will develop specialized anti-cavalry weapons, while cultures with strong religious traditions might integrate spiritual elements into everyday tools.

Consider establishing:
- Equipment specialization reflecting common threats or activities
- Resource allocation priorities visible in equipment quality variation
- Distinctive approaches to similar practical problems
- Innovation focused on culturally important activities

These patterns communicate cultural values through practical priorities rather than abstract description.

**Status Signifiers**  
Equipment often serves dual purposes as both practical tools and social indicators. Some cultures might restrict certain equipment types to specific social classes or achieved ranks, while others could use quality distinctions or decorative elements to indicate status within seemingly similar items.

Consider developing:
- Equipment-based status markers for different societies
- Visible distinctions between common and prestige versions of similar items
- Regulations governing who may carry certain equipment types
- Sumptuary laws restricting material or design elements

These systems transform equipment into social communication beyond mere mechanical function, creating roleplaying opportunities and social challenges.

### Economic Systems

Equipment availability and acquisition creates concrete manifestation of abstract economic principles:

**Price Variation**  
Equipment costs should vary based on local conditions rather than remaining fixed across all regions. Items requiring imported materials might cost substantially more in isolated regions, while equipment types produced locally could be significantly cheaper than standard prices.

Consider establishing:
- Regional price modifications for major equipment categories
- Seasonal price fluctuations for certain goods
- Supply-sensitive pricing for scarce resources
- Opportunity costs beyond simple currency exchange

This approach creates meaningful economic engagement beyond abstract wealth accumulation.

**Alternative Acquisition**  
Beyond simple purchase, equipment should be available through various methods reflecting social structures and character approaches. Service to powerful entities, guild membership, or reputation within specific communities might provide equipment access independent of financial resources.

Consider developing:
- Guild systems providing equipment access as membership benefit
- Service requirements for specialized military equipment
- Reputation thresholds for accessing restricted items
- Knowledge prerequisites for utilizing certain equipment effectively

These alternative paths create character opportunities beyond wealth accumulation while establishing equipment within social context.

**Maintenance Economics**  
Ongoing equipment costs create meaningful resource management beyond initial acquisition. Different equipment types might require specialized maintenance, consumable components, or periodic professional service to maintain effectiveness.

Consider establishing:
- Maintenance requirements for different equipment types
- Specialized tools or skills needed for proper upkeep
- Deterioration consequences for neglected equipment
- Cost-benefit analysis between high-maintenance and reliable equipment

This approach transforms equipment from static possessions into ongoing resource considerations that influence character decisions beyond the moment of acquisition.

## Equipment in Gameplay

### Equipment and Challenges

Well-designed challenges should interact meaningfully with equipment choices rather than presenting identical difficulty regardless of preparation:

**Rewarding Preparation**  
When players make thoughtful equipment choices anticipating specific challenges, these decisions should meaningfully impact their experience. Having appropriate climbing gear should substantially ease scaling obstacles, while bringing waterproofing supplies should provide significant advantages during rainstorms.

Consider designing challenges with:
- Significant difficulty reduction for appropriate equipment
- Alternative approaches accessible with specialized tools
- Impossible or extremely difficult paths without proper gear
- Efficiency benefits reducing resource expenditure with proper equipment

This approach encourages thoughtful preparation while maintaining challenge even with appropriate gear.

**Multiple Solution Paths**  
Most significant challenges should offer multiple solution approaches leveraging different equipment types rather than requiring specific items. A chasm might be crossed through climbing gear, portable bridge components, or ranged equipment establishing rope lines from a distance.

Consider designing challenges allowing:
- Multiple distinct equipment-based solutions
- Hybrid approaches combining different equipment types
- Improvisation options utilizing unexpected equipment functions
- Risk/reward tradeoffs between different equipment approaches

This design philosophy rewards creativity while maintaining challenge appropriateness.

**Environmental Interactions**  
Equipment should function differently under varied environmental conditions rather than providing consistent benefits regardless of situation. Heat might make heavy armor dangerously exhausting, waterlogged conditions could render certain weapons less effective, and high winds might compromise ranged weapon accuracy.

Consider establishing:
- Environmental effects on different equipment types
- Specialized gear mitigating environmental challenges
- Risk/benefit analysis under extreme conditions
- Tactical advantages from environmentally appropriate equipment

These interactions create dynamic gameplay responding to changing conditions rather than static optimization.

### Equipment Access Management

Controlling equipment availability presents one of the Game Master's most important balancing tools:

**Logical Limitations**  
Equipment restrictions should reflect coherent world logic rather than arbitrary limitations. If players can't acquire certain items, there should be comprehensible reasons—local production limitations, legal restrictions, or specialized knowledge requirements—rather than simple GM fiat.

Consider establishing:
- Clear regional equipment availability patterns
- Consistent prerequisites for specialized equipment access
- Logical progression paths for equipment improvement
- Transparent costs balancing power against resource investment

This approach creates satisfying equipment progression that enhances rather than undermines world coherence.

**Finding vs. Buying**  
Significant equipment should be available through multiple acquisition methods beyond simple purchase. Particularly distinctive or powerful items might require specific quests, special relationships, or rare opportunities rather than mere currency expenditure.

Consider balancing:
- Purchase access for standard equipment
- Quest requirements for unique or powerful items
- Relationship development for specialized equipment access
- Knowledge acquisition for utilizing certain equipment effectively

This approach integrates equipment acquisition with broader character development rather than treating it as separate economic activity.

**Personalized Significance**  
The most meaningful equipment often comes through narrative significance rather than superior statistics. Items received from mentors, crafted during character-defining moments, or taken from significant opponents often carry importance far beyond their mechanical properties.

Consider developing:
- Equipment with narrative history connecting to character backgrounds
- Items that grow with characters through customization or modification
- Distinctive visual or descriptive elements creating memorable presence
- Mechanical benefits reflecting personal significance rather than generic power

This approach transforms equipment from disposable tools into significant story elements that enhance character development.

### Common Equipment Situations

Certain equipment-related situations arise frequently during campaigns and benefit from consistent handling:

**Equipment Damage and Repair**  
Rather than treating equipment as either perfectly functional or completely destroyed, consider graduated damage that reduces effectiveness before complete failure. This creates more nuanced resource management and allows equipment degradation to serve as cost imposer without completely removing capabilities.

Consider systems for:
- Progressive damage reducing effectiveness before failure
- Field repairs restoring partial function
- Permanent damage requiring professional attention
- Quality impact on damage resistance and repair options

This approach creates meaningful equipment management without excessive punitive measures.

**Improvised Equipment**  
Players will inevitably attempt to utilize objects not covered by specific rules or create impromptu tools from available materials. Rather than prohibiting such creativity, establish consistent guidelines for improvisation that reward ingenuity while maintaining appropriate challenge.

Consider frameworks for:
- Determining base effectiveness for improvised items
- Skill application improving improvised equipment function
- Durability limitations for makeshift tools
- Risk/reward tradeoffs compared to proper equipment

This approach encourages creative problem-solving while maintaining mechanical balance.

**Equipment Modification**  
Characters often seek to modify standard equipment for specialized purposes or improved functionality. Rather than treating equipment as fixed entities, establish consistent systems for modification that create meaningful customization without excessive complexity.

Consider guidelines for:
- Modification costs in resources, time, and expertise
- Balanced tradeoffs between different performance aspects
- Specialization benefits against versatility reduction
- Progressive improvement through iterative modification

This approach supports character expression through equipment without creating balance issues through unlimited optimization.

**Lost or Stolen Equipment**  
Equipment separation creates meaningful stakes beyond character death but requires careful handling to maintain fun rather than creating player frustration. When important equipment becomes lost or stolen, the situation should create engaging narrative opportunities rather than simply punishing players.

Consider developing:
- Recovery quests proportional to equipment significance
- Temporary replacement options maintaining basic functionality
- Progressive clues leading to recovery opportunities
- Character development through adaptation to equipment loss

This approach transforms potential frustration into engaging narrative development.

## Equipment and Balance

### Power Scaling

Equipment progression significantly impacts overall game balance and requires thoughtful management:

**Statistical Moderation**  
Equipment improvements should provide noticeable benefits without creating exponential power growth or rendering previous challenges trivial. Consider modest statistical improvements complemented by situational advantages, expanded options, or reliability enhancements rather than simple numerical escalation.

Consider limiting:
- Numerical bonuses to key statistics (+1/+2 rather than larger increments)
- Straight damage increases in favor of situational advantages
- Generic benefits versus specialized improvements
- Stacking bonuses that create unintended combinations

This approach maintains challenge appropriateness throughout campaign progression.

**Horizontal vs. Vertical Progression**  
Equipment advancement should emphasize expanded options and situational advantages rather than strictly superior replacements. Higher-tier equipment might perform better in certain circumstances while previously acquired items retain utility in others, creating expanded tactical options rather than simple replacement cycles.

Consider developing:
- Specialized equipment for different circumstances rather than strict upgrades
- Complementary options encouraging tactical selection
- Situational advantages rather than universal improvements
- Customization paths maintaining relevance for favorite items

This approach creates meaningful progression without rendering earlier equipment obsolete.

**Pacing Considerations**  
Equipment advancement should align with overall campaign progression and character development. Major equipment improvements should typically coincide with significant milestones, maintaining appropriate challenge levels while providing concrete manifestation of character growth.

Consider aligning:
- Major equipment acquisitions with narrative accomplishments
- Access to new equipment categories with skill development
- Customization options with character specialization choices
- Equipment quality with challenge environment expectations

This coordination creates coherent progression that enhances rather than undermines narrative development.

### Problematic Equipment

Certain equipment types can create significant balance challenges requiring careful consideration:

**Narrative-Breaking Items**  
Equipment that fundamentally undermines core campaign challenges requires especially careful management. Items that render key obstacles trivial—unlimited communication devices in investigation campaigns, perfect disguise items in intrigue settings, or unlimited resource generators in survival scenarios—should have meaningful limitations or carefully controlled availability.

Consider implementing:
- Consumable limitations requiring resource management
- Situational constraints limiting universal application
- Side effects creating costs for powerful benefits
- Maintenance requirements preventing unlimited use

These constraints maintain challenge appropriateness without prohibiting interesting equipment options.

**Spotlight Monopolization**  
Some equipment types can inadvertently centralize capabilities in single characters, reducing participation opportunities for others. When introducing equipment providing unique capabilities, ensure similar opportunities exist for all characters to contribute meaningfully in their own ways.

Consider balancing:
- Distributed unique capabilities across the party
- Complementary equipment creating cooperative opportunities
- Shared resources requiring collaborative decision-making
- Multiple approach paths to similar outcomes

This approach maintains individual character significance while encouraging cooperation.

**Unintended Combinations**  
The interaction between different equipment types sometimes creates unintended consequences beyond individual item balance. Watch for combinations that might create multiplicative effects, loopholes bypassing intended limitations, or applications beyond their designed purpose.

Consider monitoring:
- Stacking bonuses from multiple equipment sources
- Creative uses extending beyond intended applications
- Interaction between equipment and character abilities
- Unanticipated synergies between seemingly unrelated items

This vigilance maintains balanced gameplay while still allowing creative equipment utilization.

### Magical and Special Equipment

Beyond standard items, exceptional equipment requires special consideration:

**Unique Properties over Statistics**  
Truly special equipment should offer distinctive capabilities rather than simply enhanced statistics. Consider items that provide unique options, specific situational advantages, or narrative permissions rather than just improved numbers for standard actions.

Develop items providing:
- New action options previously unavailable
- Situational advantages in specific circumstances
- Alternative approaches to common challenges
- Narrative permissions enabling story development

This approach creates memorable equipment that enhances gameplay options rather than simply inflating effectiveness.

**Logical Limitations**  
Powerful equipment should include appropriate limitations reflecting narrative balance rather than arbitrary restrictions. Consider requirements that create meaningful choices—activation costs, situational prerequisites, or knowledge requirements—rather than simple usage limits.

Implement limitations like:
- Resource expenditure for activation
- Circumstantial prerequisites for functionality
- Expertise requirements for effective utilization
- Maintenance needs proportional to power

These constraints create balanced gameplay while enhancing rather than undermining narrative coherence.

**Growth Potential**  
Some equipment might develop alongside characters rather than remaining static, creating long-term significance beyond immediate utility. Consider items with progressive unlocked capabilities, adaptation to user preferences, or evolution reflecting narrative developments.

Design equipment with:
- Progressive feature revelation through extended use
- Customization options reflecting user priorities
- Adaptation mechanisms responding to significant events
- Narrative development reflecting character growth

This approach creates equipment with long-term significance that evolves alongside character development rather than being regularly replaced.

## Conclusion

Equipment in Flow RPG functions best when treated as an integrated element of world design rather than isolated game mechanics. By developing thoughtful equipment cultures, meaningful acquisition methods, and balanced progression systems, you create immersive gameplay where character tools enhance narrative development and tactical options without overwhelming other game elements.

Remember that equipment exists to enable character action and express character identity rather than serving as the central focus of gameplay. The best equipment systems provide interesting options without becoming the primary motivation for character decisions, creating tools that enhance the roleplaying experience without defining or limiting it.

Above all, equipment should contribute to fun, engaging gameplay for all participants. When equipment-related rules or limitations enhance enjoyment through meaningful challenges, thoughtful preparation, and character expression, maintain them consistently; when they create frustration, arbitrary barriers, or reduced participation, adapt them to better serve the fundamental purpose of collaborative storytelling and adventure.




## Running Monsters & NPCs

# MONSTERS & NPCS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Monsters Effectively

This guide helps you leverage the monster system to create engaging, dynamic encounters that feel natural within the Flow economy.

## Encounter Building Basics

### Party Size & Threat Assessment

**Standard Party:** 4 players

**Encounter Budget by Difficulty:**

**Easy Encounter:**
- 4-6 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 2-3 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1

**Moderate Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 2-4 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 3-4 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 2 Threat 2 + 3-4 Threat 1

**Hard Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1, OR
- 2 Threat 3 champions, OR
- 5-6 Threat 2 standard enemies

**Deadly Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary (solo), OR
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary + supporting minions, OR
- 3 Threat 3 champions

### Scaling for Party Size

**3-Player Party:**
- Reduce enemy count by 1-2
- Or reduce one enemy's threat level
- Consider giving players +1 starting Flow

**5-6 Player Party:**
- Add 1-2 more enemies
- Or increase one enemy's threat level
- Or add environmental challenges

## Flow Management for Encounters

### Starting Flow

**Monsters:**
- Minions (Threat 1): 0-1 Flow
- Standard (Threat 2): 2-3 Flow
- Champion (Threat 3): 4-6 Flow
- Legendary (Threat 4): 8-12 Flow

**Players:**
- Ambush/surprise: Start at 0-2 Flow
- Standard start: 3-5 Flow (from previous encounter or scene)
- Prepared/advantageous: 5-7 Flow

### Flow During Combat

**Players Generate Flow By:**
- Successful attacks in Aggressive Stance (+1 Flow)
- Building in Defensive Stance (+1 Flow per turn)
- Defeating monsters (+1 Flow per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- Using certain calling benefits

**Monsters Generate Flow By:**
- Same rules as players (if intelligent enough)
- Minions typically don't manage Flow tactically
- Standard+ enemies can use Flow economy

**Result:** Players typically accumulate Flow advantage as combat progresses, creating dramatic momentum toward victory.

## Monster Tactics by Intelligence

### Mindless (Intelligence 0)

**Examples:** Zombies, oozes, animated objects

**Tactics:**
- Attack nearest target
- No tactical Flow usage
- No retreat
- Predictable patterns

**Running Them:**

- Anticipate player actions
- Environmental control

**Running Them:**
- Multi-turn strategies
- Save resources for key moments
- Exploit weaknesses
- Have backup plans

## Tactical Positioning

### Zones in Combat

Recall the zone system:
- **Close:** Melee range (same zone)
- **Near:** Short range (adjacent zone)
- **Far:** Long range (2+ zones away)

### Monster Positioning Tactics

**Minion Swarms:**
- Surround single targets
- Block escape routes
- Force area effect targets

**Ranged Attackers:**
- Stay at Far range
- Use cover
- Focus fire with allies

**Spellcasters:**
- Stay at Near/Far range
- Behind frontline
- Positioned for area effects

**Champions/Legendary:**
- Control center of battlefield
- Force players to come to them
- Use lair advantages

## Monster Abilities & Flow

### When to Use Abilities

**1-Flow Abilities:**
- Use early and often
- Save one for emergency
- Standard enemies can afford 2-3 per fight

**3-Flow Abilities:**
- Save for critical moments
- Champion enemies can afford 1-2 per fight
- Use when it will turn the tide

**5-Flow Abilities:**
- Legendary adversaries only usually
- Save for dramatic moments
- Use when players think they're winning

### Telegraphing Big Attacks

When a monster is about to use a powerful ability:
1. **Describe the wind-up** ("The dragon's throat glows with building flame...")
2. **Give players a chance to react** (ready defense, move, interrupt)
3. **Execute dramatically** (describe the awesome effect)

This creates tension without feeling cheap.

## Monster Death & Flow

### Defeat Generates Flow

When a monster is defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** Players gain +1 Flow (distributed to attacking player or party)
- **Threat 4:** Players gain +2 Flow

### Morale & Retreat

Intelligent monsters should retreat when:
- Leader/champion defeated
- Reduced to 25% of original force
- Clearly losing

Don't fight every battle to total annihilation—retreating enemies:
- Create recurring villains
- Feel more realistic
- Can return with reinforcements
- Provide information to players

## Special Situations

### Monster Spellcasting

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:
- Choose appropriate attribute (Mind for wizards, Will for clerics, etc.)
- Pay Flow costs
- Use same spell rules as PCs

**GM Shortcut:** Pre-select which attribute each monster caster uses to speed play.

### Monsters vs. Callings

Player callings interact with monsters:
- **Explorer:** Might trigger on first encounter with creature type
- **Scholar:** Can use knowledge to identify weaknesses
- **Protector:** Gets benefits when allies threatened
- **Avenger:** Might have specific enemy types
- **Ascendant:** Legendary adversaries provide great moments

Design encounters that let callings shine.

### Monsters vs. Stances

**Against Aggressive Players:**
- Focus fire to force Defensive switches
- Use crowd control
- Spread damage around

**Against Defensive Players:**
- Force them to act (threaten NPCs, time pressure)
- Area effects hit defensive targets
- Wear down resources

**Against Balanced Players:**
- Adapt to their tactics
- Create situations forcing stance switches
- Reward tactical play

## Environmental Factors

### Lair Advantages

Legendary adversaries in their lairs might have:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, falling rocks)
- **Minion reinforcements** (arrive each round)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, cover)
- **Magical effects** (darkness, silence zones)

### Using Terrain

**Elevation:**
- High ground grants advantage
- Low ground restricts visibility
- Falling damage is real

**Cover:**
- Grants defense bonus
- Blocks line of sight
- Can be destroyed

**Obstacles:**
- Require movement to navigate
- Create tactical positioning
- Force ranged vs. melee decisions

**Hazards:**
- Damage per turn
- Require saves/checks
- Change battlefield

## Encounter Pacing

### Opening (Rounds 1-2)

**Goals:**
- Establish positioning
- Set up combos
- Assess threats

**Monster Tactics:**
- Aggressive opening
- Use terrain
- Spread damage

### Middle (Rounds 3-4)

**Goals:**
- Execute strategies
- Adapt to threats
- Manage resources

**Monster Tactics:**
- Focus fire
- Use key abilities
- Coordinate attacks

### Climax (Rounds 5+)

**Goals:**
- Finish the fight
- Spend remaining resources
- Heroic moments

**Monster Tactics:**
- Desperate measures
- Big abilities
- All-in attacks

**Note:** Most fights should resolve in 4-6 rounds. Longer = potential slog.

## Running Multiple Monsters

### Group Initiative

To speed play:
- **Group by type:** All goblins act together
- **Clear turn order:** Players → Minions → Champions → Legendary
- **Fast resolution:** Roll all attacks at once

### Tracking HP & Flow

**Techniques:**
- Index cards for each monster/group
- Dry-erase battle mat with stats
- Note pad with quick tallies
- Digital tools if preferred

**What to Track:**
- Current Vitality
- Current Flow
- Status effects
- Used abilities

### Speeding Combat

**Do:**
- Pre-roll damage
- Group similar monsters
- Have stat blocks ready
- Describe attacks quickly

**Don't:**
- Recalculate basics every turn
- Narrate every mundane attack
- Let monster turns drag
- Over-complicate

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Too Many Monsters

**Problem:** Combat becomes tedious
**Solution:** Use fewer, more interesting monsters. 6-8 enemies max usually.

### Mistake: Ignoring Flow Economy

**Problem:** Monsters don't feel integrated
**Solution:** Track monster Flow, use abilities tactically

### Mistake: Monsters Fight to Death

**Problem:** Unrealistic, prevents recurring villains
**Solution:** Smart enemies retreat at 25% strength

### Mistake: No Tactical Variety

**Problem:** Every fight feels same
**Solution:** Mix threat levels, use terrain, vary tactics

### Mistake: Overwhelming Opening

**Problem:** Players feel helpless early
**Solution:** Build difficulty, use minions early, save champions for middle

## Improvising Monsters

Need a monster on the fly?

### 30-Second Monster

1. **Threat Level:** Based on party level and desired difficulty
2. **Vitality:** Use threat level guidelines
3. **Guard:** 7 + threat level + 1d4
4. **Attack:** 2d6 + threat level
5. **One Simple Ability:** Costs 1 Flow, does something interesting

**Example:** Sudden ambush by bandits? Threat 2, Vitality 10, Guard 10, Attack 2d6+2, Ability: "Smoke Bomb" (1 Flow - create obscurement, escape).

### Scaling Existing Monsters

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce Vitality by 25%
- Reduce starting Flow by 2
- Remove one ability

**Make Harder:**
- Increase Vitality by 50%
- Increase starting Flow by 2-3
- Add one ability
- Increase attributes by +1

## Creating Memorable Fights

### Elements of Great Encounters

1. **Clear Stakes:** What happens if players lose?
2. **Interesting Terrain:** More than empty room
3. **Tactical Choices:** Multiple valid approaches
4. **Dramatic Pacing:** Build to climax
5. **Character Moments:** Let PCs shine

### Set-Piece Battles

**Legendary Adversary Phases:**
- Phase 1: Initial tactics (full strength)
- Phase 2: Escalation at 50% (desperation, new abilities)
- Phase 3: Final stand at 25% (all-out, environmental collapse)

**Waves:**
- Wave 1: Initial enemies
- Wave 2: Reinforcements arrive (round 3)
- Wave 3: Champion/legendary shows up (round 5)

**Environmental Changes:**
- Building collapses
- Fire spreads
- Water rises
- Darkness falls

## Encounter as Story

Every combat tells a story:
- **Setup:** Who, where, why
- **Complication:** Unexpected element
- **Climax:** Critical moment
- **Resolution:** Consequences

Don't just run fights—narrate battles that players remember.

---

## Quick Reference: Running Combat

**Each Round:**
1. Declare actions (players describe intent)
2. Roll initiative if needed (or use set order)
3. Resolve actions (attacks, abilities, movement)
4. Update Flow (generate/spend, track)
5. Check morale/conditions
6. Narrate results dramatically

**GM Reminders:**
- Track monster Flow
- Use abilities tactically
- Retreat when appropriate
- Describe awesome moments
- Keep pacing brisk

*Running monsters well makes combat engaging. Use the Flow economy, think tactically, and create memorable battles that serve the story.*




# Part II: Monsters & NPCs


Creating memorable adversaries and populating your world with compelling non-player characters.

# MONSTERS & NPCS - INTRODUCTION

## Overview

Monsters and NPCs in Flow RPG are designed using the same Flow economy that drives player characters. This creates dynamic, engaging encounters where every action matters and the tactical interplay between players and adversaries flows naturally from the core mechanics.

## Design Philosophy

### Flow-Based Balance

Monsters aren't balanced by hit points and damage—they're balanced by their relationship to the Flow economy:

- **Minions** generate Flow for players through easy defeats
- **Standard enemies** create balanced Flow exchanges
- **Champions** challenge players' Flow management
- **Legendary adversaries** force critical resource decisions

### Simple but Tactical

Monster stat blocks are intentionally streamlined:
- **Easy to run** at the table
- **Clear motivations** drive tactical decisions
- **Interesting abilities** without excessive complexity
- **Scalable** through simple modifications

### Integrated with Core Systems

Monsters work with the same rules as PCs:
- Use the same Flow economy
- Follow stance rules (when applicable)
- Cast spells using the flexible system
- Interact with all PC abilities naturally

---

```

---

## Quick Monster Creation

To create a monster quickly:

### 1. Choose Threat Level
Determines baseline stats and Flow

### 2. Set Core Stats
- **Vitality:** Threat 1 = 3-6, Threat 2 = 8-12, Threat 3 = 14-20, Threat 4 = 25-40+
- **Guard:** Threat 1 = 6-8, Threat 2 = 9-11, Threat 3 = 12-14, Threat 4 = 15-18+
- **Starting Flow:** Threat 1 = 0-1, Threat 2 = 2-3, Threat 3 = 4-6, Threat 4 = 8-12

### 3. Assign Attributes
- **Primary:** The monster's key strength (+2 to +4)
- **Secondary:** Supporting attributes (+0 to +2)
- **Weak:** Dump stats (-1 to 0)

### 4. Create Attacks
- **Damage:** 2d6 + relevant attribute
- **Range:** Based on concept
- **Special Properties:** Keep it simple (1-2 max)

### 5. Add 1-3 Abilities
- **Cost Flow** appropriately
- **Match threat level** (minions get simple abilities, legendary adversaries get complex ones)
- **Support tactics** and role

### 6. Write Tactics Section
- How does it fight?
- When does it use abilities?
- What are its goals?

---

## Monster Types

Monsters come in various categories that inform their abilities and behavior:

### Beasts
Natural animals, often enhanced or dire versions
- Use Body and Awareness primarily
- Instinctive tactics
- Pack mentality or solo hunters

### Humanoids
Intelligent bipeds with society and culture
- Use tools and tactics
- Can have any class abilities
- Negotiate or can be reasoned with

### Undead
Animated dead or deathless spirits
- Often mindless or single-minded
- Immune to many conditions
- May have life-draining abilities

### Constructs
Animated objects or magical creations
- Immune to mind-affecting
- Follow programming/orders
- Unusual vulnerabilities

### Dragons & Monsters

- Lair advantages
- Iconic, memorable encounters

### Aberrations
Unnatural, alien beings
- Weird abilities
- Break normal rules
- Psychologically disturbing

---

## Flow Dynamics in Combat

Understanding how monsters interact with the Flow economy:

### Flow Generation
- **Players generate Flow** by defeating monsters (+1 per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- **Players generate Flow** through successful attacks in Aggressive Stance
- **Monsters generate Flow** the same way (if intelligent/tactical)

### Flow Usage
- **Minions** rarely use abilities (no Flow)
- **Standard enemies** use 1-Flow abilities tactically
- **Champions** can afford multiple abilities
- **Legendary adversaries** manage Flow like PCs

### Encounter Pacing
- **Start:** Players often at moderate Flow, monsters at starting value
- **Middle:** Flow exchanges as attacks succeed, abilities fire
- **End:** Players have accumulated Flow from defeats, finish strong

This creates natural dramatic pacing where players build momentum through the encounter.

# MONSTERS & NPCS - SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## How Monsters Integrate with PC Systems

Monsters aren't a separate system—they participate fully in the Flow economy and interact naturally with all PC abilities. This document explains those interactions in detail.

## Monsters and the Flow Economy

### Flow Generation

Monsters generate Flow the same way PCs do:

**In Aggressive Stance:**
- Successful attack = +1 Flow

**In Defensive Stance:**
- Each turn spent building = +1 Flow
- Can use defensive abilities

**From Defeats:**
- When monster defeats enemy = +1 Flow (if intelligent enough to capitalize)
- Usually only matters for smart/elite monsters

### Flow Expenditure

Monsters spend Flow on:
- Special abilities (cost varies)
- Spells (if spellcaster)
- Enhanced attacks
- Defensive reactions

### Starting Flow by Threat Level

- **Threat 1 (Minions):** 0-1 Flow
- **Threat 2 (Standard):** 2-3 Flow
- **Threat 3 (Elite):** 4-6 Flow
- **Threat 4 (legendary adversary):** 8-12 Flow

### Flow from Defeating Monsters

Players gain Flow when monsters are defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** +1 Flow to party
- **Threat 4:** +2 Flow to party

**Distribution Options:**
- **To attacker:** Player who landed killing blow gets Flow
- **To party:** Distribute evenly or strategically
- **GM discretion:** Whatever keeps game moving

## Monsters and Combat Stances

### Intelligent Monsters Use Stances

**Aggressive Stance:**
- Berserkers, aggressive beasts
- Generate Flow through attacks
- Trade defense for offense

**Defensive Stance:**
- Tanks, defensive fighters
- Build Flow, improve Guard
- Protect allies or objectives

**Balanced Stance:**
- Most standard enemies
- Versatile, no penalties
- Adapt to situation

**Note:** Mindless monsters don't consciously choose stances—just use Balanced as default.

### Monsters vs. Player Stances

**When Players in Aggressive:**
- Monsters take more damage
- Players generate more Flow
- Consider defensive monsters or spread attacks

**When Players in Defensive:**
- Harder to hit players
- Players building Flow
- Use area effects or force action

**When Players in Balanced:**
- Standard interactions
- Adapt to their tactics
- Mix your approaches

## Monsters and Magic

### Monster Spellcasters

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:

**Choose Casting Attribute:**
- **Wizard-type:** Mind (precision, control)
- **Sorcerer-type:** Awareness (power, instinct)
- **Cleric-type:** Will (reliability, faith)
- **Bard-type:** Presence (social, fear)

**Follow Same Rules:**
- Pay Flow costs
- Roll 2d6 + Attribute + Sorcery
- Same success thresholds
- Same spell effects

**GM Shortcuts:**
- Pre-select attribute for each caster
- Note which spells they know
- Track Flow separately

### Example Monster Spellcasters

**Goblin Shaman (Threat 2)**
- Casts with Awareness (instinctive)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Heal
- Starts with 3 Flow
- Uses Bolt until low, then heals self

**Enemy Wizard (Threat 3)**
- Casts with Mind (calculated)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Shield, Fireball
- Starts with 5 Flow
- Opens with Shield, uses Bolt, saves Fireball for groups

**Demon Lord (Threat 4)**
- Casts with Will (overwhelming power)
- Knows: Most spells including Master tier
- Starts with 10 Flow
- Can cast at negative Flow (Will attribute)

### Counterspelling Monsters

Players can Dispel monster spells:
- Ready action to counter
- Roll Dispel vs. monster's casting roll
- Costs player's Flow
- Dramatic moment

## Monsters and Callings

Player callings interact with monsters naturally:

### Explorer

**Pioneering Spirit:**
- First encounter with new monster type = +1 Flow
- Discovering monster lairs = calling trigger
- "I've never seen one of *these* before!"

**Design Consideration:** Include variety of monster types in adventures

### Scholar

**Pursuit of Knowledge:**
- Can retroactively add knowledge check about monster
- Learn weaknesses or tactics
- "Actually, I remember reading about these..."

**Design Consideration:** Have interesting lore for key monsters

### Protector

**Shield of the Weak:**
- Gains benefits when ally threatened by monster
- Protecting NPCs from monsters = calling trigger
- "Not while I still stand!"

**Design Consideration:** Include threatened innocents or party members

### Ascendant

**Reach for Greatness:**
- legendary adversary battles = perfect calling moment
- Signature dramatic actions against epic foes
- "This is my moment!"

**Design Consideration:** Make legendary adversary fights memorable

### Avenger

**Right Past Wrongs:**
- Specific monster types as sworn enemies
- Extra benefits against chosen foe type
- "This is for what you did!"

**Design Consideration:** Include appropriate enemy types

### Wanderer

**Journey Before Destination:**
- Discovering monsters in exotic locations = trigger
- "I wonder what we'll find here..."

**Design Consideration:** Varied, interesting encounter locations

### Healer

**Mend the Wounded:**
- Healing party after tough monster fight = trigger
- "Let me tend to those wounds..."

**Design Consideration:** Meaningful damage from monsters

### Artisan

**Craft and Create:**

## Encounter Balancing with Systems

### Action Economy

**The Most Important Factor:**

**4 Players vs. 2 Elites:** Players have advantage

**Solution:** Mix threat levels
- 1 Champion + 4 Minions = balanced for 4 players
- Champion provides threat, minions provide action parity

### Flow Economy

**Monitor Flow Totals:**

**Players Start:** 3-5 Flow each = 12-20 total
**Monsters Start:** Varies by threat level

**During Fight:**
- Players accumulate from defeats
- Smart monsters use abilities to pressure
- By end, players usually have Flow advantage

**Result:** Natural momentum toward player victory

### Resource Attrition

**Multiple Encounters:**
- Deplete player resources (Flow, Vitality, abilities)
- Minion fights between major encounters
- Rest/recovery between adventure segments

**Single Big Fight:**
- Players can nova (use everything)
- Make it count—legendary adversary should be memorable
- Allow time to build Flow first

## Creating Challenging Encounters

### What Makes Fights Hard

**NOT Just More HP:**
- Higher Vitality alone = slog
- Boring if monster just "tank"

**Tactical Challenges:**
- Monster abilities force decisions
- Environmental hazards
- Time pressure
- Protect innocent NPCs
- Multiple objectives

**Resource Pressure:**
- Multiple encounters before rest
- Flow depletion
- Vitality damage
- Ability usage

### Encounter Difficulty Knobs

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce monster count
- Lower starting Flow
- Remove one ability
- Better player positioning

**Make Harder:**
- Add 1-2 monsters
- Increase starting Flow
- Add environmental hazard
- Worse player positioning
- Time pressure

### When to Adjust On-the-Fly

**Fight Too Easy:**
- Reinforcements arrive
- Monster gets "second wind"
- Environmental complication

**Fight Too Hard:**
- Monster retreats early
- Reinforcements for players
- Environmental advantage appears

**Never:** Just fudge dice repeatedly—kills tension

They have vast resources, multiple powerful abilities, and the tactical intelligence to challenge entire experienced parties.

## Design Notes

**Role:** Campaign villains, legendary creatures, climactic encounters

**Usage:**
- Solo against full party (typically 4-6 players)
- May have supporting minions or environmental advantages
- Multi-phase fights with changing tactics
- Require full party coordination and resource management

**Flow Impact:**
- Start with 8-12 Flow
- Can use advanced and master abilities
- Generate +2 Flow when defeated (double normal)
- Force party to use ALL accumulated resources

**Design Considerations:**
- **Lair Actions:** Consider adding environmental effects every round
- **Legendary Resistances:** Can succeed on failed saves (limited uses)
- **Phase Transitions:** Change tactics at half/quarter Vitality
- **Minion Support:** Often fought alongside lesser creatures
- **Extended Battles:** Designed for 6-10+ round encounters

## Using Legendary Adversaries

### Multi-Phase Design

Major adversary encounters should have clear phases with changing tactics:

**Phase 1 (100%-50% Vitality):**
- Confident, uses moderate abilities
- Tests party capabilities
- Uses minions and lair actions

**Phase 2 (50%-25% Vitality):**
- More aggressive
- Uses powerful abilities
- Shifts tactics based on threats

**Phase 3 (Below 25% Vitality):**
- Desperate or enraged
- Uses most powerful abilities
- All resources committed

### Lair Advantages

Boss encounters are often more interesting in prepared environments:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, traps, collapsing ceilings)
- **Minion reinforcements** (waves of lesser creatures)
- **Magical effects** (scrying, teleportation circles, buffs)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, difficult terrain for party)

### Solo or Supported?

**Pure Solo Adversary:**
- Higher Vitality
- More abilities
- Lair actions compensate for action economy

**Adversary + Minions:**
- Slightly lower adversary stats
- Minions add complexity
- Adversary uses minions tactically

### Pacing Considerations

Legendary encounters should be epic and memorable:
- **6-10+ rounds** typical duration
- **Flow accumulation** party builds resources through fight
- **Dramatic moments** legendary resistances, phase transitions, near-death saves
- **Tactical variety** each phase feels different

### Escape and Consequences

Many major villains shouldn't die on first defeat:
- **Contingency escapes** (teleport, dimension door, etc.)
- **Phylacteries** (liches, certain undead)
- **Planar nature** (demons, devils reform in home plane)
- **Loyal minions** (sacrifice themselves to save adversary)

This creates recurring villains and ongoing story arcs.

---

## Customizing Legendary Adversaries

### Scaling Up
- **More Vitality** (+5-10 per party member above 4)
- **Higher Flow** (+2-4 for larger parties)
- **Extra abilities** (1 additional ability per 2 party members above 4)
- **Minion support** (add Threat 1-2 minions)

### Scaling Down
- **Less Vitality** (-5-10 for smaller party)
- **Lower Flow** (-2-4 starting Flow)
- **Remove complex abilities** (keep iconic ones only)
- **Reduce lair actions** (every other round instead of every round)

### Thematic Variations

Same chassis, different story:
- **Adult Red Dragon** → Adult Blue Dragon (lightning breath, desert lair)
- **Lich** → Mummy Lord (Egyptian themed, desert curses)
- **Beholder** → Death Tyrant (undead beholder, negative energy)
- **Demon Lord** → Devil Duke (lawful evil, contracts, different abilities)
- **Archmage** → Archdruid (nature spells, Wild Shape, beast summons)

---

*Legendary adversaries are the pinnacle of challenge in Flow RPG. They should be memorable, epic encounters that require full party coordination and resource management. Design them to be climactic moments that define campaigns.*



# NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS (NPCs)

NPCs are the supporting cast of your campaign—allies, rivals, merchants, nobles, and everyday people who populate the world. Unlike monsters designed primarily for combat, NPCs serve narrative and social functions with combat statistics available when needed.

## Design Philosophy

NPCs should be:
- **Quick to create** - Use simplified stat blocks
- **Narratively rich** - Personality and goals drive behavior
- **Flexible** - Easy to scale up/down for different situations
- **Social first** - Combat stats are secondary to role

---

## NPC Stat Block Format

NPCs use a simplified format compared to combat monsters:

```
NPC NAME
Role: [Brief description]
Motivation: [What drives them]

ATTRIBUTES (if combat occurs)
Primary: [+X]  Secondary: [+X]  Other: [+0 to +1]

DEFENSES (if needed)
Vitality: [X]  Guard: [X]  Flow: [X]

KEY SKILLS
- [What they're good at]
- [Notable abilities]
- [Social influence]

PERSONALITY
[Brief description of how they act]

CONNECTIONS
[Who they know, what they control]
```

---

- **Competent** (Threat 1) - Basic training
- **Skilled** (Threat 2) - Professional level
- **Expert** (Threat 3) - Master of their craft
- **Legendary** (Threat 4) - World-class capability

### Step 3: Assign Key Attributes
Only detail what matters for their role:
- Combat NPC: Body, Awareness
- Social NPC: Presence, Will
- Knowledge NPC: Mind
- Perceptive NPC: Awareness

### Step 4: Add Personality
3-5 descriptive traits that drive behavior

### Step 5: Establish Connections
Who they know, what resources they control

## Using NPCs Effectively

### Social Encounters

NPCs shine in non-combat interactions:

**Information:**
- Know things PCs don't
- Have price or condition for sharing
- May lie or mislead based on motivation

### Converting to Combat

If NPC enters combat unexpectedly:

**Quick Conversion:**
1. Estimate Threat level from narrative role
2. Use appropriate template
3. Focus on narrative over precision

**Example:**
"The kindly merchant reveals himself as a disguised assassin!"
- Was Threat 0 merchant
- Now Threat 2 rogue (stats from standard enemies)
- Add narrative twist to abilities

# Part III: Encounter Design


Using the Flow economy to create balanced, engaging encounters.

# COMBAT SYSTEM

## Stance-Based Combat

Rather than using traditional initiative rolls, this game uses a stance system that determines turn order based on tactical choices. Each round, you choose one of three stances that reflect your approach to the fight.

### The Three Stances

**Aggressive Stance**
*"Strike first, strike hard"*

- **Turn Order:** Act first
- **Flow Generation:** +1 Flow on successful attacks
- **Damage Bonus:** +1 to all damage rolls
- **Defense Penalty:** -1 to defense rolls
- **Movement:** Must move toward nearest enemy if able
- **Special Ability:** Charge - Move 2+ zones and attack for +2 damage

**Balanced Stance**
*"Adapt and overcome"*

- **Turn Order:** Act second
- **Flow Generation:** +1 Flow on any critical success
- **Damage:** Normal
- **Defense:** Normal
- **Movement:** Complete freedom
- **Special Ability:** Once per combat, switch stance as a free action

**Defensive Stance**
*"Patience and protection"*

- **Turn Order:** Act last (choosing your moment)
- **Flow Generation:** +1 when attacked, +1 on successful defense
- **Damage Penalty:** -1 to damage rolls
- **Defense Bonus:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Movement:** Can disengage without penalty
- **Special Ability:** Counterattack on critical defense success

### Stance Switching Rules

Stance switching is now **free** (no Flow cost). You can change your stance at the start of each round based on tactical needs. The Balanced stance special ability allows one additional stance change during combat as a free action.

### Turn Order Specifics

1. **Aggressive stance characters** act first (pressing the attack)
2. **Balanced stance characters** act second 
3. **Defensive stance characters** act last (waiting to react)

Within each stance group, highest Grace acts first, with ties favoring players over NPCs.

---

## Flow Zones & Positioning

Combat occurs across abstract distance zones that determine engagement and weapon effectiveness.

### The Three Core Zones

**Engaged**
- In melee with specific opponents
- Melee weapons operate normally
- Cannot use bows or other ranged weapons
- Switching weapons is free
- Cannot move past enemies without special abilities

**Close**
- One move from any engagement
- Throwing weapons operate at optimal range
- Bows and ranged weapons operate normally
- Can move into Engaged zone as normal movement
- Enemies can't directly attack you with melee weapons

**Far**
- Two moves from any engagement
- Optimal for bows and ranged attacks
- Melee fighters cannot attack targets at Far range
- Spells may still reach depending on description
- Safe from immediate melee threats

### Movement Between Zones

- **Standard Movement:** One zone per round
- **Double Movement:** Two zones if taking no other action
- **Engagement:** Moving into the same zone as an enemy puts you in Engaged position
- **Disengagement:** Moving from Engaged to Close requires specific stance or abilities

### Stance Effects on Movement

**Aggressive Stance Movement:**
- Moving Far → Close → Engaged generates +1 Flow per zone crossed
- Cannot disengage from enemies without switching stance
- Must close to Engaged if possible (seeking combat)

**Balanced Stance Movement:**
- Normal movement (one zone per round)
- Can choose to engage or disengage as preferred
- Can move two zones if taking no other action

**Defensive Stance Movement:**
- Can disengage from Engaged to Close freely
- Gains +1 Flow when enemies close to Engaged with you
- Can maintain preferred distance more easily

### Ranged Combat by Zone

- **Engaged:** Cannot use bows, -2 penalty with thrown weapons
- **Close:** Thrown weapons gain +1 Flow, bows work normally
- **Far:** Optimal for bows (+1 damage), thrown weapons cannot reach

---

## Health System
## Health System

Characters have two health resources that work together to model both minor and serious injuries.

### Guard

Guard represents your ability to avoid serious harm through armor, dodging, and tactical positioning.

- **Formula:** 8 + Higher of (Might or Grace) + (Total Milestones × 2)
- **Function:** Ablative defense that absorbs damage first (allows both tough and agile defenders)
- **Recovery:** Fully restored between scenes
- **In-Combat Recovery:** Can use Rally action to recover 1d6 Guard (once per scene)

**Why Two Options?**
Using the higher of Might or Grace allows both tough fighters (high Might) and agile defenders (high Grace) to be effective. This creates build diversity without penalizing character concepts.

**Milestone Scaling:**
Guard increases with each milestone you achieve, making characters significantly more resilient as they advance. The doubled scaling (×2) represents improved combat awareness, better positioning, and tactical experience.

**Milestone Tracking:**
Keep a running total of all milestones achieved (minor, moderate, and major) on your character sheet. Multiply this total by 2 and add it to your Guard score.

### Vitality

Vitality represents your core health and ability to withstand serious injury.

- **Formula:** 10 + Will + (Major Milestones × 3)
- **Function:** Core health representing serious injury
- **Consequences:** Damage to Vitality often causes lasting effects
- **Critical Point:** At 0 Vitality, you fall unconscious and begin dying

**Major Milestone Scaling:**
Vitality only increases with major milestones (every 12-15 sessions), making it a slowly growing resource that keeps death meaningful while reducing lethality at high levels.

### Damage Resolution

1. Attacker rolls damage (typically weapon dice + modifiers)
2. Subtract armor damage reduction (if any)
3. Remaining damage is applied to Guard first
4. Once Guard is depleted, further damage reduces Vitality
5. At 0 Vitality, character falls unconscious and begins dying

### Death & Dying Rules

When reduced to 0 Vitality, you fall unconscious and begin dying.

**Death Saves:** Roll 2d6 + Will at the start of each turn:
- **6 or less:** Lose 1 Vitality (getting worse)
- **7-8:** Stable for this round
- **9-11:** Stabilize at 0 Vitality (unconscious but stable)
- **12+:** Regain consciousness at 1 Vitality

**Death:** Occurs at -3 Vitality (down from -5)
**Stabilization:** Medicine check (TN 8) or any magical healing
**Recovery:** Regain 1 Vitality per hour of rest after stabilization

---

## Combat Actions

---





# Part IV: Managing the Flow Economy


The Flow economy is the heart of the game. Here's how to use it to create dramatic pacing.

## BASIC MECHANICS

### Core Resolution System

**Basic Roll:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill

Roll two six-sided dice, add your relevant attribute modifier (ranging from -5 to +5) and your skill rating (ranging from -2 to +8). Compare the total to the target number to determine your success.

**Standard Target Number:** 8 (moderate difficulty)

**Difficulty Scale:**
- **Trivial (TN 6):** Routine tasks under pressure
- **Easy (TN 7):** Basic professional work
- **Standard (TN 8):** Challenging professional tasks
- **Hard (TN 10):** Expert-level challenges
- **Extreme (TN 12):** Near-impossible feats
- **Legendary (TN 14):** Mythic achievements

**Success Tiers:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates Flow for opponent or creates consequences)
- **7-9:** Partial Success (succeeds with a cost or complication)
- **10-12:** Full Success (achieves your goal as intended)
- **13+:** Critical Success (generates extra Flow and exceptional results)
- **Beat TN by 5+:** Enhanced Success (gain advantage on next roll)
- **Beat TN by 8+:** Legendary Success (major narrative permission)

### The Flow System

Flow is the central resource that powers combat techniques, spells, and narrative advantages. It represents your character's momentum, focus, and command of the situation.

**Flow Range:** -3 to +6 (reduced from original)

**Starting Flow:** 0 (neutral position)
- **Exception:** Scholars start each scene at +1 Flow

**Flow States:**
- **Positive Flow (+1 to +6):** "In the flow," riding momentum, advantage
- **Zero Flow (0):** Neutral state, balanced position
- **Negative Flow (-1 to -3):** Disrupted, struggling, disadvantage

**Generating Flow:**
- Critical success on any roll: +1 Flow
- Successful attack in Aggressive stance: +1 Flow
- Successful defense in Defensive stance: +1 Flow
- Being attacked while in Defensive stance: +1 Flow (once per round)
- Taking any damage: +1 Flow (new rule - helps all characters maintain momentum)
- Casting a cantrip successfully: +1 Flow
- Archetype abilities (varies)
- Calling-specific triggers (rebalanced for reliability)

**Spending Flow:**
- Enhance dice rolls (+1 per point spent)
- Trigger combat techniques (varies by technique)
- Cast intermediate and advanced spells (-1 to -3)
- Access narrative advantages (GM discretion)
- No cost for stance switching (revised from original)

**Core Philosophy:** Flow is moment-to-moment momentum that ebbs and flows naturally. All character types can generate Flow through their preferred playstyle - aggressive fighters through offense, defensive fighters through protection, and spellcasters through magical success.

### Attribute System

**Attribute Range:** -5 to +5 (0 = human average)

**The Six Attributes:**

**Physical Attributes**
- **Might:** Raw physical power, strength, and endurance
- **Grace:** Agility, coordination, precision, and speed

**Mental Attributes**
- **Mind:** Intellect, reasoning, calculation, and knowledge
- **Awareness:** Perception, intuition, and attunement to surroundings

**Social Attributes**
- **Will:** Mental fortitude, determination, and spiritual power
- **Presence:** Charisma, force of personality, and social influence

**Key Principle - Approach Matters:** When making a check, you use the specific attribute that matches your approach, not a predetermined attribute for each skill.

*Example: Intimidating someone could use:*
- **Might** if physically threatening them
- **Mind** if pointing out logical consequences
- **Presence** if using sheer force of personality

### Skill System

Skills represent your character's training and expertise in various areas. Each skill has five possible ratings:

**Five-Tier Progression:**
1. **Untrained** (-2 modifier): No formal training
2. **Novice** (-1 modifier): Basic understanding
3. **Competent** (+0 modifier): Functional capability
4. **Professional** (+1 modifier): Skilled practitioner
5. **Expert** (+2 modifier): Peak human mastery

**Advancement Limits by Milestone Type:**
- **Starting Characters:** Maximum Competent (+0), one Professional (+1) from archetype
- **Minor Milestones:** Can advance skills up to Professional (+1)
- **Moderate Milestones:** Can advance skills to Expert (+2)

**The 15 Core Skills:**

**Physical Skills (5)**
- **Combat:** Fighting, weapons, and tactical positioning
- **Athletics:** Running, climbing, swimming, and feats of strength
- **Stealth:** Hiding, sneaking, and avoiding detection
- **Survival:** Tracking, living off the land, and navigation
- **Finesse:** Fine manipulation, lockpicking, and sleight of hand

**Mental Skills (5)**
- **Lore:** History, academics, and specialized knowledge
- **Medicine:** Healing, anatomy, and treating injuries
- **Craft:** Making, repairing, and engineering objects
- **Investigate:** Searching, analyzing, and finding clues
- **Sorcery:** Magical theory and spellcasting practice

**Social Skills (5)**
- **Persuade:** Convincing others through reason and charm
- **Deceive:** Lying, disguising, and misdirection
- **Perform:** Entertainment, inspiration, and artistic expression
- **Command:** Leadership, intimidation, and issuing orders
- **Empathy:** Understanding others' emotions and motivations

### Physical Skill Decision Tree

When determining which physical skill to use, ask these questions:

**Is this combat-related (attacking, defending, tactical positioning)?**
- Yes → Use **Combat**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve delicate manipulation or precise finger work?**
- Yes (lockpicking, disarming traps, sleight of hand, pickpocketing) → Use **Finesse**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve avoiding detection or moving unseen?**
- Yes (hiding, sneaking, tailing someone) → Use **Stealth**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve outdoor survival or wilderness skills?**
- Yes (tracking, foraging, navigation, animal handling) → Use **Survival**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve physical exertion or strength?**
- Yes (climbing, jumping, swimming, running, breaking down doors) → Use **Athletics**

**Common Examples:**
- **Climbing a wall:** Athletics (physical exertion)
- **Climbing a wall silently:** Athletics + Stealth (GM might require two rolls or grant advantage)
- **Picking a lock:** Finesse (delicate manipulation)
- **Breaking down a door:** Athletics (strength/force)
- **Dodging an attack in combat:** Combat (tactical defense)
- **Jumping over a pit:** Athletics (physical feat)
- **Sneaking past guards:** Stealth (avoiding detection)
- **Tracking a creature:** Survival (wilderness skill)
- **Disarming a trap:** Finesse (delicate work)

**Attribute Choice Matters:**
Remember, your approach determines which attribute pairs with the skill:
- **Might + Athletics:** Forcing a door, carrying heavy loads
- **Grace + Athletics:** Acrobatic maneuvers, parkour
- **Might + Combat:** Heavy weapon strikes, shield bashing
- **Grace + Combat:** Finesse weapon attacks, dodging
- **Grace + Finesse:** Standard lockpicking, sleight of hand
- **Mind + Finesse:** Complex locks requiring understanding mechanisms

### Scene Resolution

Most gameplay occurs in scenes that follow this structure:

1. **Set the Scene:** GM describes situation and stakes
2. **Declare Approach:** Players state what they're trying to do and how
3. **Determine Roll:** GM assigns appropriate Attribute + Skill combination
4. **Roll Dice:** Player rolls 2d6 + Attribute + Skill
5. **Interpret Results:**
   - **6-:** Failure or complication
   - **7-9:** Success with a cost
   - **10-12:** Full success
   - **13+:** Critical success
6. **Narrate Outcome:** GM and player collaborate on describing what happens
7. **Flow Adjustments:** Award or deduct Flow based on outcome

### Dice Conventions

**Standard Roll:** 2d6 + modifiers
**Advantage Die:** Add 1d6, keep highest two
**Disadvantage:** Roll 3d6, keep lowest two
**Exploding Dice:** On damage rolls, any die showing a 6 is rolled again and added

### Example Resolution

**Scenario:** Climbing a crumbling tower while under arrow fire.

**Player:** "I'll use my climbing experience to find the most stable route, testing stones before putting my weight on them."

**GM:** "That's Athletics, but your careful approach uses Awareness rather than Might. Roll Awareness + Athletics."

**Player:** "I have Awareness +2 and Athletics at Competent (+0), so that's 2d6+2."

*Rolls 2d6: 4, 3 = 7, plus 2 = 9*

**GM:** "A 9 is a partial success. You make it up, but one of the stones you thought was stable breaks loose. You're hanging by one hand, and will need another check to pull yourself up before the next volley of arrows."

**Player:** "I'll spend 1 Flow to boost my roll to 10 for a full success instead."

**GM:** "Perfect. You catch yourself as the stone breaks and smoothly pull up to the next level just as arrows thunk into the spot where you were hanging."



# Part V: Campaign Frameworks


Structure your campaign around the Flow RPG systems for maximum engagement.

# Using Calling Evolution in Campaigns

## Introduction to Calling Growth

Callings are not static labels but dynamic frameworks that evolve as characters develop. This evolution follows predictable patterns based on the Enneagram system, with each Calling having characteristic growth and stress directions. Understanding these patterns helps players create compelling character arcs and provides GMs with tools to create meaningful character development opportunities.

## Core Evolution Principles

### Callings Change But Don't Disappear
- Characters never completely lose their core Calling
- Evolution means integrating new aspects rather than replacement
- Original motivations remain but become more nuanced

### Three Types of Evolution
1. **Deepening** - More mature expression of the same Calling
2. **Integration** - Incorporating positive aspects of growth direction
3. **Disintegration** - Exhibiting negative aspects of stress direction

### Milestone Connection
- Minor Milestones often represent Deepening
- Moderate Milestones can trigger Integration opportunities
- Major Milestones may involve significant evolution

## Stress Directions

When under extreme pressure, characters may exhibit unhealthy aspects of another Calling. This "disintegration" represents how core drives manifest when a person feels threatened or insecure.

### Full Stress Direction Map
- **Advocate → Exemplar**: Becomes obsessed with being seen as perfect
- **Guardian → Champion**: Becomes controlling and domineering
- **Exemplar → Mediator**: Becomes apathetic and disengaged
- **Seeker → Guardian**: Becomes clingy and dependent
- **Scholar → Enthusiast**: Becomes scattered and hyperactive
- **Sentinel → Exemplar**: Becomes competitive and status-focused
- **Enthusiast → Advocate**: Becomes critical and perfectionistic
- **Champion → Scholar**: Retreats into isolation and planning
- **Mediator → Sentinel**: Becomes anxious and reactive

### Stress Indicators
Watch for these signs that a character is moving toward their stress direction:

#### Advocate Stress
- Becomes preoccupied with appearance of perfection
- Shifts focus from principles to personal achievement
- Increasingly concerned with how others perceive their virtue

#### Guardian Stress
- Becomes demanding rather than supportive
- Uses help as a means of control
- Grows resentful when others don't appreciate their sacrifice

#### Exemplar Stress
- Loses motivation and drive
- Becomes indifferent to former goals
- Avoids conflict even when important

#### Seeker Stress
- Becomes needy and dependent
- Excessively concerned with others' approval
- Abandons unique identity to please others

#### Scholar Stress
- Jumps between unrelated ideas
- Becomes impulsive and unfocused
- Seeks distraction rather than understanding

#### Sentinel Stress
- Becomes competitive and image-conscious
- Measures worth through external validation
- Abandons loyalty for personal advancement

#### Enthusiast Stress
- Becomes hypercritical of self and others
- Focuses on flaws rather than possibilities

# Part VI: Character Advancement


Pacing character growth and managing milestone advancement.

# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

## The Milestone System

This game uses milestone-based advancement instead of experience points. Milestones represent significant moments of character growth and development that occur naturally through the story.

### Philosophy Behind Milestones

- **Story-Driven Growth:** Characters advance when the narrative calls for it
- **No Bookkeeping:** No need to track XP or calculate advancement
- **GM Control:** The GM determines when milestones occur based on story pacing
- **Equal Advancement:** All characters reach milestones together

### Types of Milestones

There are three tiers of milestones, each representing a different magnitude of character development:

1. **Minor Milestones:** Small but meaningful growth (individual development)
2. **Moderate Milestones:** Substantial character development (group achievement)
3. **Major Milestones:** Transformative evolution (campaign-defining moments)

---

## Minor Milestones

Minor milestones occur frequently and represent individual character growth moments.

### When to Award Minor Milestones

- After completing a single session
- Upon resolving a challenging encounter
- When characters make a small but meaningful discovery
- After successful use of skills in a significant way
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 1-2 sessions

### Minor Milestone Options

Choose ONE of the following when you reach a minor milestone:

**Skill Development**
- Advance one skill up one tier (Untrained → Novice → Competent → Professional)
- Gain a new skill at Novice level (-1)
- Note: Cannot advance beyond Professional tier (+1) with minor milestones

**Attribute Adjustment**
- Adjust one attribute by +1/-1 (representing shift in focus or retraining)
- Total attribute points must remain the same
- Example: Lower Grace by -1 to raise Mind by +1

**Combat Edge**
- Gain a minor combat improvement (see Combat Edges list below)
- Edges provide incremental power growth
- Can take same Edge multiple times if limit allows

**Skill Edge**
- Gain +1 to specific application of a skill
- Example: +1 to Athletics when climbing
- Narrows focus for specialized expertise

**Flow Edge**
- Increase maximum Flow capacity by +1 (can take up to 3 times)
- Example: Increases max Flow from +6 to +7

### Combat Edges

Minor improvements that provide incremental power growth. Some edges can be taken multiple times up to their limit.

| Edge | Benefit | Limit |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Weapon Focus** | +1 damage with one weapon type | Once per weapon type |
| **Armor Training** | Reduce armor penalty by 1 | Once per armor type |
| **Tough** | +2 Guard | Twice |
| **Hardy** | +2 Vitality | Twice |
| **Quick Draw** | Switch weapons as free action | Once |
| **Combat Reflexes** | +1 to defense rolls | Once |
| **Fast Movement** | +1 zone of movement per turn | Once |
| **Precise Strike** | Reroll one damage die per attack | Once |
| **Flow Harmony** | +1 maximum Flow capacity | Three times |
| **Defensive Fighter** | +1 Guard when in Defensive stance | Once |

### Minor Milestone Example

*After successfully infiltrating the governor's mansion and discovering evidence of corruption, the party reaches a minor milestone.*

**Elena (Cleric)** chooses to adjust her attributes, lowering Presence by -1 to raise Awareness by +1, reflecting her growing perceptiveness to danger.

**Magnus (Fighter)** learns the Press Advantage combat technique, allowing him to deal +1d6 damage when his Flow is positive.

**Lyra (Wizard)** advances her Investigate skill from Competent (+0) to Professional (+1), having honed her analytical abilities during the mission.

### Appropriate Challenges After Minor Milestones

Characters who have experienced a few minor milestones are appropriate for:
- Local threats (bandits, wolves, minor undead)
- Small-scale local problems
- Threats to villages or small communities

---

## Damage Scaling

Your damage output increases automatically as you gain milestones, keeping pace with enemy advancement:

**Milestone Damage Bonus:**
- **Every 2 Milestones:** +1 damage with all attacks
- **At 5 Total Milestones:** Weapon damage die increases (d6 → d8)
- **At 10 Total Milestones:** Gain exploding dice (6s are rerolled and added)
- **At 15 Total Milestones:** Weapon die increases again (d8 → d10)

**Example Progression:**
- **Start (0 milestones):** 2d6 + Might = 10 avg damage
- **2 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 1 = 11 avg damage
- **4 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 2 = 12 avg damage
- **5 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 2 = 13 avg damage
- **10 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 5 (with exploding) = 18 avg damage

This progression ensures martial characters remain effective against increasingly powerful threats throughout a campaign.

# Balancing Archetypes and Party Composition

This document explains how Archetypes integrate with the core Flow RPG system mechanics, detailing how these professional traditions interact with skills, combat, magic, and other subsystems.

## Archetype and Skill System

### Skill Proficiency Framework

Archetypes determine a character's starting skill proficiencies, providing a foundation of professional training:

- **Professional (+1):** Core competencies central to the archetype's function
- **Novice (-1):** Secondary skills that support the archetype's approach
- **Untrained (-2):** Skills outside the archetype's typical training

### Skill Advancement Patterns

While any character can advance any skill, each archetype offers natural advancement paths:

- **Primary Path:** Skills central to archetype identity advance at standard cost
- **Secondary Path:** Related skills advance at standard cost
- **Cross-Training:** Skills from other archetypes advance at increased cost

### Archetype Skill Specialties

Each archetype approaches skills with distinctive focus areas:

**Fighter:**

# Magic Balance and Flow Management

## How Magic Integrates with Core Systems

Magic in Flow RPG isn't a separate subsystem—it's fully integrated into the core mechanics through the Flow economy and stance system. This document explains how magic interacts with other game elements.

## Magic and the Flow Economy

### Flow as Universal Power Source

Magic fundamentally depends on Flow:

1. **Spell Costs**
   - Tier 0 (Cantrips): Generate +1 Flow on success
   - Tier 1 (Basic Spells): 0 Flow cost
   - Tier 2 (Advanced Spells): -1 Flow
   - Tier 3 (Expert Spells): -2 Flow
   - Tier 4 (Master Spells): -3 Flow

2. **Flow Generation**
   - Spellcasters generate Flow through multiple methods:
   - **Cantrips:** +1 Flow on successful casting
   - **Aggressive Stance:** +1 Flow when offensive spells deal damage
   - **Defensive Stance:** +1 Flow when attacked (once per round)
   - **Taking Damage:** +1 Flow when taking any damage
   - **Critical Success:** +1 Flow when rolling 13+ on any spell
   - **Key Rule:** Aggressive stance combines with cantrip generation for +2 Flow per successful Spark

3. **Negative Flow Considerations**
   - Most casters cannot cast at negative Flow
   - Will-based casting is the exception (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md))
   - Going negative has narrative consequences (exhaustion, patron displeasure, etc.)
   - Recovering from negative Flow is slower (see Recovery section below)

### Tactical Flow Management

Smart spellcasters manage Flow strategically:

**Conservative Approach:**
- Use cantrips (0 Flow) as your default action
- Save Flow for critical moments
- Cast standard spells (-1 Flow) regularly
- Reserve advanced/master spells for emergencies

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Spend Flow early for maximum impact
- Use powerful spells to end fights quickly
- Risk going negative for victory
- Rely on Will casting or allies to recover

**Balanced Approach:**
- Mix cantrips and standard spells
- Monitor party's total Flow
- Coordinate with allies for Flow generation
- Keep reserve for defensive/utility casting

## Magic and Combat Stances

### Aggressive Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- Offensive spells that defeat enemies generate +1 Flow

- Dispel to counter enemy magic
- Mage Armor maintenance

### Stance Transitions

Changing stances is a significant decision:

1. **Spell Maintenance**
   - Most ongoing effects persist through stance changes
   - GM may rule particularly disruptive changes break concentration
   - Will casting specifically maintains through changes
   - Stance Anchor items protect specific effects

2. **Tactical Considerations**
   - Switch to Aggressive for finishing blows
   - Switch to Defensive when injured
   - Switch to Balanced for multi-purpose turns
   - Coordinate stance changes with party

## Spell Scaling with Advancement

Spells automatically improve as characters gain milestones, ensuring magical power keeps pace with martial advancement:

### Damage Spell Scaling

**At 3 Milestones:**
- Damage spells gain +1d6
- Example: Bolt goes from Attribute + 1d6 to Attribute + 2d6
- Applies to all damage-dealing spells (Spark, Bolt, Fireball, etc.)

**At 6 Milestones:**
- All spells gain +1 to their save TN
- Enemy saves become harder to succeed
- Increases effectiveness of control/debuff spells

**At 10 Milestones:**
- Damage spells gain another +1d6
- Example: Fireball goes from 2d6 to 3d6
- Significantly increased combat power

**At 15 Milestones:**
- Can cast one tier higher for same cost once per scene
- Example: Cast a Tier 2 spell for 0 Flow, or Tier 3 for -1 Flow
- Represents mastery of magical efficiency

### Spell Progression Example

**Bolt (Tier 1 Basic Spell):**
- **Start:** Attribute + 1d6 damage, 0 Flow cost
- **3 Milestones:** Attribute + 2d6 damage, 0 Flow cost
- **6 Milestones:** Attribute + 2d6 damage, 0 Flow cost, +1 save TN
- **10 Milestones:** Attribute + 3d6 damage, 0 Flow cost, +1 save TN
- **15 Milestones:** Can cast as Tier 0 (generates +1 Flow) once per scene

This progression ensures spellcasters remain competitive with martial damage scaling throughout a campaign.

# Equipment Balance and Treasure
*How Equipment Interacts with Core Game Mechanics*

## Introduction

Equipment in Flow RPG doesn't exist as an isolated subsystem but integrates meaningfully with all major game mechanics. This integration creates dynamic gameplay where item selection influences and is influenced by character abilities, tactical choices, and narrative development rather than functioning as a separate consideration.

This document outlines how equipment interacts with Flow RPG's major systems, providing both mechanical guidance and thematic context for these relationships.

## Equipment & Attributes

Equipment interacts with character attributes in bidirectional relationships where physical statistics influence equipment options while gear choices can modify effective attribute expressions:

### Attribute Requirements

Many equipment types have minimum attribute values for effective use, reflecting physical or mental prerequisites:

**Might Requirements**  
Heavy weapons and armor typically require minimum Might scores to utilize effectively. Characters with insufficient Might can still technically use these items but suffer penalties representing their struggle with unwieldy equipment:
- Heavy weapons impose disadvantage on attack rolls for characters with Might below requirements
- Heavy armor reduces movement and imposes disadvantage on physical actions for characters with insufficient Might
- Two-handed weapons cannot be properly wielded by characters more than 2 points below requirements

**Grace Requirements**  
Precision weapons and specialized tools often require minimum Grace scores for effective operation. Characters with insufficient Grace can use these items but without accessing their full capabilities:
- Finesse weapons lose their Grace-based damage bonus for characters below requirements
- Specialized tools impose disadvantage on relevant skill checks when used with insufficient Grace
- Some ranged weapons become inaccurate beyond short range without adequate Grace

**Mind Requirements**  
Complex devices, magical implements, and analytical tools may require minimum Mind scores to properly utilize. Characters lacking sufficient Mind can operate these items at basic levels but cannot access advanced functions:
- Magical implements reduce spell effectiveness when used with insufficient Mind
- Complex mechanical devices function unpredictably for characters below Mind requirements
- Technical equipment provides incomplete information without adequate understanding

These requirements create natural equipment specialization without arbitrary class restrictions, allowing characters to gravitate toward items aligning with their inherent capabilities while maintaining freedom to attempt using any equipment type.

### Attribute Expression

Equipment can modify how effectively characters utilize their natural attributes, either enhancing or restricting attribute expression:

**Attribute Enhancement**  
Some equipment amplifies natural capabilities, allowing more effective attribute utilization:
- Precision tools might add +1 to effective Grace for specific skill applications
- Specialized lifting equipment could increase effective Might for specific strength tasks
- Analytical instruments may enhance effective Mind for particular knowledge applications

**Attribute Restriction**  
Other equipment limits attribute expression despite natural capabilities:
- Heavy armor typically caps maximum Grace bonus applicable to defense
- Bulky equipment might limit maximum movement regardless of natural speed
- Restrictive helmets could reduce effective Awareness for perception checks

**Compensatory Equipment**  
Some items provide alternative means of accomplishing tasks normally requiring specific attributes:
- Mechanical assists might allow accomplishing Might-based tasks through technical advantage
- Guidance systems could enable precision without relying entirely on personal Grace
- Reference tools may provide information normally requiring high Mind scores

This system creates meaningful equipment choices beyond simple numerical optimization, requiring thoughtful selection based on how items interact with character attributes in specific contexts.

## Equipment & Skills

The relationship between equipment and skills extends beyond simple bonuses to create qualitatively different application options:

### Enabling Skills

Some equipment makes skill application possible in contexts where it would otherwise be impossible:
- Climbing gear enables Athletics checks on otherwise impossible surfaces
- Lockpicks allow Thievery application to secured containers
- Translation references permit Language checks with otherwise unknown scripts

Without appropriate equipment, certain skill applications are simply unavailable regardless of character proficiency level. This creates meaningful preparation decisions while establishing logical constraints without arbitrary restrictions.

### Modifying Difficulty

Appropriate equipment frequently adjusts the difficulty of skill challenges:
- Proper tools typically reduce skill check difficulty by one level
- Improvised equipment usually maintains standard difficulty
- Attempting skills without necessary tools often increases difficulty by one level
- Specialized equipment designed for specific tasks may reduce difficulty by two levels

This scaling creates meaningful advantage for prepared characters without rendering challenges trivial or punishing improvisation excessively.

### Expanding Options

Beyond simple difficulty modification, equipment often enables alternative skill applications:
- Disguise kits allow Deception to function through visual means rather than just verbal
- Survey tools permit Perception to create lasting, accurate records rather than momentary awareness
- Communication devices enable Social skills at distances normally impossible

These expanded options create qualitatively different outcomes rather than simply enhancing existing capabilities, providing meaningful choice beyond numerical advantages.

### Skill Synergies

The relationship between skills and equipment becomes particularly powerful when considering how multiple proficiencies interact:
- Craft skill allows maintaining and modifying equipment, improving reliability or customizing function
- Knowledge skills provide insights into optimal equipment utilization in specific contexts
- Perception identifies environmental factors affecting equipment effectiveness

This interconnection creates depth beyond simple "skill plus equipment equals result" calculations, rewarding character investment across multiple complementary areas.

## Equipment & Combat

The combat system interacts extensively with equipment choices, creating tactical options far beyond simple damage calculations:

### Stance Interactions

Equipment functions differently within Flow's stance-based combat system, creating distinctive tactical profiles:

**Aggressive Stance Equipment**  
- Two-handed weapons gain additional damage benefits
- Light armor provides enhanced movement options
- Thrown weapons can be used as part of closing actions
- Some weapon types gain additional critical effects

**Balanced Stance Equipment**  
- Versatile weapons demonstrate greatest efficiency
- Medium armor provides optimal protection without significant penalties
- Dual-wielding becomes particularly effective
- Shields can be used for both protection and offensive techniques

**Defensive Stance Equipment**  
- Shields provide enhanced protection effects
- Heavy armor damage reduction increases
- Reach weapons maintain threat zones
- Specialized defensive items gain additional effects

These stance-specific advantages create meaningful tactical choices based on both equipment selection and combat approach rather than establishing universally optimal loadouts.

### Weapon Categories

Beyond simple damage values, weapons in Flow represent distinctive tactical approaches:

**Impact Weapons (Hammers, Maces, Flails)**  
- Strongest against rigid protection
- Can cause stagger effects disrupting enemy actions
- Effective for breaking objects and structures
- Often slower but with higher single-hit potential

**Cutting Weapons (Swords, Axes, Polearms)**  
- Balanced damage profile across different situations
- Can cause bleeding effects dealing ongoing damage
- Effective against most unarmored or lightly armored targets
- Variable speed and damage based on specific design

**Piercing Weapons (Daggers, Spears, Rapiers)**  
- Strongest against soft targets or at weak points
- Can bypass portions of armor protection with precision
- Effective for exploiting specific vulnerabilities
- Often faster but with lower base damage

**Ranged Weapons (Bows, Crossbows, Thrown)**  
- Allow engagement at distances impossible for melee
- Limited by ammunition availability and management
- Affected by environmental conditions like wind or visibility
- Often vulnerable in extremely close combat

These distinctive profiles create meaningful specialization and tactical adaptation rather than simple damage comparison, allowing characters to develop expertise with specific weapon types while encouraging situational selection based on anticipated challenges.

### Armor Systems

Armor represents more than simple damage reduction, providing distinctive protection profiles:

**Light Armor (Leather, Padded, Hide)**  
- Minimal penalties to movement or agility
- Allows full Flow generation from mobility
- Compatible with Grace-focused fighting styles
- Provides modest but reliable protection

**Medium Armor (Chain, Scale, Breastplate)**  
- Moderate penalties to specific Grace-based actions
- Restricts Flow generation from certain movement types
- Balances protection and mobility
- Provides substantial defense without severe limitations

**Heavy Armor (Plate, Full Harness)**  
- Significant penalties to Grace applications
- Restricts stance options and Flow generation
- Requires specific Might thresholds for proper use
- Provides superior protection against most damage types

**Shields (Buckler, Standard, Tower)**  
- Occupy one hand but provide active defense options
- Can be used offensively in certain situations
- Allow specialized defensive techniques
- Provide variable protection based on size and user skill

These systems create meaningful protection choices beyond simple numerical comparison, requiring consideration of expected threats, fighting style, and environmental conditions rather than defaulting to the highest protection value available.

### Equipment and Flow

Combat equipment interacts significantly with the Flow resource system:

**Flow Generation**  
Different equipment types create distinctive Flow generation patterns:
- Light weapons generate Flow through rapid, precise strikes
- Heavy weapons generate Flow through powerful, decisive blows
- Appropriate weapons against specific enemies generate additional Flow
- Some armor types restrict Flow generation from certain actions

**Flow Techniques**  
Equipment enables distinctive Flow techniques beyond generic combat options:
- Weapon-specific techniques requiring particular implement types
- Armor-based defensive techniques available only with certain protection
- Shield techniques creating unique defensive options
- Combined equipment techniques requiring specific loadouts

**Flow Enhancement**  
Flow expenditure can temporarily enhance equipment performance:
- Weapons can deliver extraordinary attacks through Flow empowerment
- Armor can provide exceptional protection against specific threats
- Shields can create expanded protection zones affecting allies
- Specialized equipment can perform beyond normal parameters

This integration creates distinctive combat expressions based on equipment selection, encouraging specialization while maintaining tactical flexibility through Flow resource management.

## Equipment & Magic

Magical systems interact extensively with equipment, both enhancing and constraining arcane capabilities:

### Casting Implements

Magical equipment influences spellcasting in several important ways:

**Casting Facilitation**  
Appropriate implements enhance spellcasting effectiveness:
- Staves provide stability for complex or lengthy spells
- Wands enhance precision for targeted effects
- Orbs support area-effect spellcasting
- Symbols strengthen specific magical traditions

**Casting Constraints**  
Equipment can restrict spellcasting capabilities:
- Heavy armor makes most spellcasting impossible
- Medium armor imposes penalties on casting checks
- Some weapons interfere with somatic components
- Certain materials disrupt specific magical traditions

**Specialized Implementations**  
Some implements support particular magical approaches:
- Tradition-specific tools enhance certain magical styles
- Element-focused implements strengthen specific effects
- Purpose-built items support particular spell categories
- Custom implements align with personal casting methods

These relationships create meaningful equipment decisions for spellcasters, requiring thoughtful selection rather than defaulting to simplistic optimization.

### Magical Interaction

Equipment responds differently to magical effects based on composition and design:

**Material Responsiveness**  
Different materials interact distinctively with magical energies:
- Iron disrupts certain fae magics
- Silver conducts spiritual energies

## Design Notes

### Core Design Philosophy

This game system was designed with the following principles:

#### Elegance Over Complexity
- Simple, unified resolution system
- Minimal bookkeeping and calculation
- Deep decision space without excessive rules

#### Narrative-First with Tactical Depth
- Story drives mechanics, not vice versa
- Tactical options for those who want them
- Every rule supports the fiction

#### Flow as Universal Resource
- Single resource unifying all subsystems
- Dynamic economy creating dramatic pacing
- Intuitive resource that mirrors character momentum

#### Player Agency
- Meaningful choices in character building
- Tactical decisions in combat
- Narrative permissions granting special capabilities

### Playtest Insights

Extensive playtesting revealed several key insights that shaped the final system:

#### What Worked Best
- Flexible magic system creates diverse casters
- Stance-based combat eliminates initiative bottleneck
- Flow economy creates natural pacing
- The Three Pillars (Species/Archetype/Calling) create rich characters

#### Ongoing Balance Considerations
- Monitor Guard scaling at higher milestones
- Watch Halfling weapon damage penalty
- Observe Scholar Calling retroactive dice benefit
- Track Will casting as "emergency button"

#### The Magic of Unexpected Combinations
The most memorable characters came from unexpected combinations:
- Dwarf Wizard Exemplar (proving dwarves can master magic)
- Halfling Paladin Advocate (tiny crusader for justice)
- Elf Fighter Scholar (martial arts as academic study)
- Human Ranger Seeker (finding themselves in wilderness)

### Final Thoughts

This system aims to occupy the "rules-moderate" space between narrative games and tactical simulators. It provides enough mechanical crunch to satisfy strategic players while maintaining narrative flexibility for storytellers.

The Flow system serves as the unifying element that bridges combat, magic, and social interactions into a cohesive whole. By making Flow the central resource, all character actions feel connected to the same underlying game economy.

Most importantly, the system encourages players to create characters driven by internal motivation (Calling) as much as external capability (Species and Archetype). This three-dimensional approach creates richer roleplaying opportunities and more memorable heroes.

2. **Sorcery Investment:** How much?
3. **Spell Selection:** Combat/utility/social?
