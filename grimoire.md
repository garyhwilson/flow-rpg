# Introduction: The Art of Magic


Magic in Flow RPG is revolutionary. This grimoire explores the complete spell system in depth.

# SPELLS - INTRODUCTION

## Overview

Magic in Flow RPG represents one of the most revolutionary aspects of the system: a unified casting framework where spells adapt to the caster's approach rather than being locked to a single tradition. This modular documentation covers the complete spell system, from basic cantrips to legendary master spells.

## Core Magic Philosophy

### The Flow of Magic

Magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Flexible Casting System

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

## Magic Access Requirements

Magic access is determined by your archetype and attributes:

**Universal Rule:** If your archetype provides the Sorcery skill, you can cast spells regardless of your attributes.
- This applies to Wizards, Clerics, Bards, and Paladins
- Your archetype training overrides the normal attribute requirements
- Represents formal magical education and practice

**Alternative Access:** Characters without a spellcasting archetype can learn magic if:
- **Mind + Awareness ≥ +2** (Arcane magic)
- **Will + Presence ≥ +2** (Divine magic)
- **Awareness + Will ≥ +2** (Primal magic)

This creates meaningful choices for non-caster archetypes while ensuring spellcasting archetypes can fulfill their role.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

## Spell Categories

Spells are divided into five tiers based on power level and Flow cost:

### Tier 0: Cantrips (Generate +1 Flow on Success)
- Simple magics that build momentum rather than consuming it
- Successfully casting a cantrip generates +1 Flow
- Available to all casters from the start
- Examples: Spark, Light, Mage Armor, Prestidigitation

### Tier 1: Basic Spells (0 Flow Cost)
- Fundamental spells that maintain Flow equilibrium
- The bread and butter of magical combat and utility
- No Flow cost, making them reliable and sustainable
- Examples: Bolt, Shield, Charm, Blur, Detect Magic

### Tier 2: Advanced Spells (-1 Flow Cost)
- Powerful effects that require minimal momentum investment
- Moderate Flow cost enables frequent use
- Significant battlefield impact
- Examples: Fireball, Heal, Fly, Invisibility, Web

### Tier 3: Expert Spells (-2 Flow Cost)
- Major magical effects requiring significant focus
- Higher Flow investment for dramatic results
- Game-changing capabilities
- Examples: Lightning Bolt, Teleport, Polymorph, Scrying, Wall of Fire

### Tier 4: Master Spells (-3 Flow Cost)
- Reality-altering magic at the peak of mortal capability
- Requires substantial Flow but delivers legendary effects
- Can fundamentally change encounters
- Examples: Time Stop, Dominate, Meteor Swarm, True Resurrection, Wish

## Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells affects your spellcasting ability:

- **No Armor:** +1 bonus to Sorcery checks (unrestricted magical flow)
- **Light Armor:** No penalty (compatible with spellcasting)
- **Medium Armor:** -1 to Sorcery checks (minor restriction)
- **Heavy Armor:** -3 to Sorcery checks (difficult but possible)

This rebalancing allows armored spellcasters (like Clerics and Paladins) to function effectively while maintaining meaningful trade-offs. Certain species traits and abilities can further reduce these penalties.

## Spells and Flow Generation

Spellcasters generate Flow through multiple methods, ensuring they participate actively in the Flow economy:

**Cantrips Generate Flow:**
- Successfully casting any cantrip generates +1 Flow
- This makes cantrips excellent for building momentum
- No Flow cost means you're always gaining when successful

**Aggressive Stance:**
- When you successfully cast an offensive spell that deals damage, gain +1 Flow
- Applies to all damage-dealing spells (Spark, Bolt, Fireball, etc.)
- Combines with cantrip Flow generation for Spark

**Taking Damage:**
- When you take damage (regardless of armor), gain +1 Flow
- Helps spellcasters recover from being targeted
- Universal Flow generation for all character types

**Critical Success:**
- Rolling 13+ on any casting roll generates +1 Flow
- Rewards high-skill casting

**Example Flow Economy:** A wizard casts Spark (cantrip) in Aggressive Stance and hits. They gain +1 Flow from cantrip success and +1 Flow from Aggressive successful attack, for a total of +2 Flow. Later, they cast Fireball (-1 Flow) and hit, spending 1 Flow but gaining 1 Flow back from Aggressive, for net 0 Flow cost.

## Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

## Design Philosophy

The spell system adheres to Flow RPG's core design principles:

1. **Elegance over Complexity** - One unified casting mechanic instead of multiple subsystems
2. **Narrative-First with Tactical Depth** - Same spell, different narrative based on approach
3. **Flow as Universal Resource** - Magic fully integrated into the Flow economy
4. **Player Agency** - Choose how to cast each spell based on the situation

---

*This spell system represents the flexible, narrative-driven approach to magic that defines Flow RPG. Every casting choice creates a unique story while maintaining mechanical clarity and balance.*

# The Magic System in Detail

## Core Magic Concepts

### The Flow of Magic

In this world, magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Magic Access Requirements

Not everyone can cast spells. To access magic, a character must have:

- **Mind + Awareness ≥ +2** total
- This represents the minimum mental acuity and perceptual awareness needed to sense and manipulate magical Flow
- Approximately 45% of the population meets this requirement
- Even Wizards, Clerics, and Bards must meet this requirement!

This requirement creates meaningful attribute choices without being overly restrictive. Failing to meet the requirement doesn't mean you can never cast—you can increase these attributes through milestones.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

---

## Flexible Casting System

### Core Mechanic

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute. Instead:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

### Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells imposes penalties:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

Certain species traits and abilities can reduce these penalties, like the Elven Focus trait that ignores the first point of armor penalty.

### Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

---

## Spell Categories

Spells are divided into three categories based on power level and Flow cost:

### Cantrips (0 Flow)
- Basic magical effects that require no Flow expenditure
- Available to all casters regardless of skill
- Limited but useful effects
- Examples: Spark, Light, Mage Armor

### Standard Spells (-1 Flow)
- Common magical effects that cost 1 Flow
- Bread and butter of magical combat and utility
- Examples: Bolt, Shield, Charm, Blur

### Advanced Spells (-3 Flow)
- Powerful magic requiring 3 Flow
- Game-changing effects with significant impact
- Examples: Fireball, Heal, Invisibility, Dispel

### Master Spells (-5 Flow)
- Highest tier of magic requiring 5 Flow
- Legendary effects that can turn the tide of battle
- Examples: Lightning Storm, Teleport, Dominate, Time Stop

## Magical Traditions

While the mechanical system of magic is unified through the Flow system, the world contains various magical traditions that reflect different cultural approaches to spellcasting.

### Arcane Academies
- **Primary Attribute:** Mind
- **Focus Items:** Spellbooks, wands, staves
- **Philosophy:** Magic is a science to be studied and mastered through intellect
- **Practitioners:** Wizards, arcanists, battle mages

### Wild Talent
- **Primary Attribute:** Awareness
- **Focus Items:** Natural items, crystals, tattoos
- **Philosophy:** Magic is an innate power that flows through all things
- **Practitioners:** Sorcerers, elementalists, witches

### Divine Channeling
- **Primary Attribute:** Will
- **Focus Items:** Holy symbols, sacred texts, relics
- **Philosophy:** Magic is a gift from higher powers channeled through faith
- **Practitioners:** Clerics, paladins, oracles

### Performance Magic
- **Primary Attribute:** Presence
- **Focus Items:** Musical instruments, masks, props
- **Philosophy:** Magic is a performance that reshapes reality through belief
- **Practitioners:** Bards, enchanters, illusionists

Note that any caster can use any attribute regardless of their tradition—these are cultural frameworks, not mechanical restrictions.

---

## Enchanted Items

Magical items in this system interact with the Flow economy in various ways:

### Types of Enchanted Items

**Flow Batteries**
- Store Flow points for later use
- Typically have a capacity of 1-3 Flow
- Recharge between scenes or through specific actions

**Spell Catalysts**
- Reduce Flow cost of specific spells by 1 (minimum 0)
- Often tied to a specific casting attribute
- Example: "Mind Lens: When casting with Mind, reduce Bolt cost by 1 Flow"

**Attribute Enhancers**
- Temporarily boost a specific attribute for spellcasting
- Don't affect other uses of the attribute
- Example: "Awareness Amulet: +1 Awareness when casting spells"

**Stance Anchors**
- Maintain a spell's effect even when changing stances
- Normally, some spell effects might end when changing stances
- Example: "Sentinel Ring: Maintain one defensive spell when switching stances"

### Using Enchanted Items

- Most require attunement (conscious connection to the item)
- Characters can typically attune to a number of items equal to their Will attribute (minimum 1)
- Using an item's power generally requires an action unless specified otherwise
- Some items have limited charges or uses per scene/day

---

## Tactical Magic Guidelines

### Which Attribute When?

**Use Mind when:**
- Precision targeting is crucial
- Allies are mixed with enemies
- You need to understand complex magical interactions
- Controlled, calculated effects are more important than raw power

**Use Awareness when:**
- Maximum damage is the priority
- You need to detect weaknesses or hidden magic
- Instinctive reactions are required
- You're in unfamiliar magical territory

**Use Will when:**
- You're at negative Flow but need to cast anyway
- Maintaining concentration under duress is important
- You need to push through resistance or counterspells
- Reliability matters more than optimization

**Use Presence when:**
- Social effects should accompany the magic
- Intimidation or inspiration is tactically useful
- Multiple targets need to be influenced
- The appearance of the spell matters as much as its effect

### Magic in Combat Stances

**Aggressive Stance Magic**
- Focus on damaging spells
- Mind for precision targeting
- Awareness for maximum damage
- Can generate Flow from successful offensive spells

**Balanced Stance Magic**
- Versatile, adaptive casting
- Good for utility spells
- Can quickly switch to other stances for specific effects

**Defensive Stance Magic**
- Protective and reactive spells
- Will casting for concentration
- Mage Sight is enhanced in this stance
- Good position for setting up complex spells

# How Magic Integrates with Everything

## How Magic Integrates with Core Systems

Magic in Flow RPG isn't a separate subsystem—it's fully integrated into the core mechanics through the Flow economy and stance system. This document explains how magic interacts with other game elements.

## Magic and the Flow Economy

### Flow as Universal Power Source

Magic fundamentally depends on Flow:

1. **Spell Costs**
   - Tier 0 (Cantrips): Generate +1 Flow on success
   - Tier 1 (Basic Spells): 0 Flow cost
   - Tier 2 (Advanced Spells): -1 Flow
   - Tier 3 (Expert Spells): -2 Flow
   - Tier 4 (Master Spells): -3 Flow

2. **Flow Generation**
   - Spellcasters generate Flow through multiple methods:
   - **Cantrips:** +1 Flow on successful casting
   - **Aggressive Stance:** +1 Flow when offensive spells deal damage
   - **Defensive Stance:** +1 Flow when attacked (once per round)
   - **Taking Damage:** +1 Flow when taking any damage
   - **Critical Success:** +1 Flow when rolling 13+ on any spell
   - **Key Rule:** Aggressive stance combines with cantrip generation for +2 Flow per successful Spark

3. **Negative Flow Considerations**
   - Most casters cannot cast at negative Flow
   - Will-based casting is the exception (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md))
   - Going negative has narrative consequences (exhaustion, patron displeasure, etc.)
   - Recovering from negative Flow is slower (see Recovery section below)

### Tactical Flow Management

Smart spellcasters manage Flow strategically:

**Conservative Approach:**
- Use cantrips (0 Flow) as your default action
- Save Flow for critical moments
- Cast standard spells (-1 Flow) regularly
- Reserve advanced/master spells for emergencies

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Spend Flow early for maximum impact
- Use powerful spells to end fights quickly
- Risk going negative for victory
- Rely on Will casting or allies to recover

**Balanced Approach:**
- Mix cantrips and standard spells
- Monitor party's total Flow
- Coordinate with allies for Flow generation
- Keep reserve for defensive/utility casting

## Magic and Combat Stances

### Aggressive Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- Offensive spells that defeat enemies generate +1 Flow
- Natural fit for damage-dealing magic
- Mind precision keeps allies safe
- Awareness maximizes damage output

**Drawbacks:**
- -2 to Guard makes caster vulnerable
- Encourages burning Flow quickly
- Less time for defensive spells
- Risky for fragile spellcasters

**Best Spells:**
- Spark (cantrip for Flow generation)
- Bolt (standard ranged attack)
- Fireball (advanced area damage)
- Lightning Storm (master devastation)

### Balanced Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- Versatile, no penalties
- Good for utility spells
- Can switch to other stances as needed
- Maintains decent defense

**Drawbacks:**
- No Flow generation bonus
- No defensive bonus
- Jack-of-all-trades, master of none
- Less optimal than specialized stances

**Best Spells:**
- Any utility spells
- Charm and social magic
- Invisibility and stealth
- Heal and support spells

### Defensive Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- +2 to Guard protects vulnerable casters
- Can build Flow (+1 per turn)
- Can use Mage Sight instead of building Flow
- Maintains concentration better
- Will casting excels here

**Drawbacks:**
- No offensive Flow generation
- Slower pacing
- Party may need you to act faster
- Less dramatic casting style

**Best Spells:**
- Shield and protective magic
- Blur and evasion spells
- Dispel to counter enemy magic
- Mage Armor maintenance

### Stance Transitions

Changing stances is a significant decision:

1. **Spell Maintenance**
   - Most ongoing effects persist through stance changes
   - GM may rule particularly disruptive changes break concentration
   - Will casting specifically maintains through changes
   - Stance Anchor items protect specific effects

2. **Tactical Considerations**
   - Switch to Aggressive for finishing blows
   - Switch to Defensive when injured
   - Switch to Balanced for multi-purpose turns
   - Coordinate stance changes with party

## Spell Scaling with Advancement

Spells automatically improve as characters gain milestones, ensuring magical power keeps pace with martial advancement:

### Damage Spell Scaling

**At 3 Milestones:**
- Damage spells gain +1d6
- Example: Bolt goes from Attribute + 1d6 to Attribute + 2d6
- Applies to all damage-dealing spells (Spark, Bolt, Fireball, etc.)

**At 6 Milestones:**
- All spells gain +1 to their save TN
- Enemy saves become harder to succeed
- Increases effectiveness of control/debuff spells

**At 10 Milestones:**
- Damage spells gain another +1d6
- Example: Fireball goes from 2d6 to 3d6
- Significantly increased combat power

**At 15 Milestones:**
- Can cast one tier higher for same cost once per scene
- Example: Cast a Tier 2 spell for 0 Flow, or Tier 3 for -1 Flow
- Represents mastery of magical efficiency

### Spell Progression Example

**Bolt (Tier 1 Basic Spell):**
- **Start:** Attribute + 1d6 damage, 0 Flow cost
- **3 Milestones:** Attribute + 2d6 damage, 0 Flow cost
- **6 Milestones:** Attribute + 2d6 damage, 0 Flow cost, +1 save TN
- **10 Milestones:** Attribute + 3d6 damage, 0 Flow cost, +1 save TN
- **15 Milestones:** Can cast as Tier 0 (generates +1 Flow) once per scene

This progression ensures spellcasters remain competitive with martial damage scaling throughout a campaign.

- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Elven Focus (ignore first point)
- Magic items that reduce penalties
- High base casting bonus offsets penalties
- Tactical stance choices

**Building Armored Casters:**
1. Elf in Light Armor = no penalty
2. High Sorcery + Mind offsets light armor penalty
3. Defensive Stance reduces need for heavy armor
4. Shield spell provides magical protection

### Weapons and Casting

**Free Hand Requirement:**
- Most spells require a free hand for gestures
- Weapons in one hand, casting with other
- Two-handed weapons prevent most spellcasting
- Some traditions use weapon as focus (staff, ritual dagger)

**Weapon + Spell Combos:**
- Attack with weapon, cast spell same turn (if system allows)
- Cast defensive spell, attack with weapon
- Use weapon in Aggressive, spell in Balanced
- Coordinate for narrative awesome

### Focus Items

Different traditions use different focus items:

**Arcane (Mind):**
- Spellbooks (for learning/reference)
- Wands (precise channeling)
- Staves (versatile tools)
- Component pouches

**Wild (Awareness):**
- Natural items (crystals, feathers)
- Tattoos or body art
- Blood or life essence
- Environmental channeling

**Divine (Will):**
- Holy symbols
- Sacred texts
- Relics
- Prayer beads

**Performance (Presence):**

- Audience participation

Focus items are **narrative elements**, not mechanical requirements, unless you want to add that layer to your game.

## Magic and Advancement

### Improving Casting

Characters improve magical ability through:

**Milestone Advances:**
1. **Increase Sorcery** - Makes all casting better
2. **Increase Casting Attribute** - Improves chosen approach
3. **Gain New Spells** - Expand spell repertoire
4. **Magic-Related Skills** - Support casting narratively

**In-Game Learning:**
- Find spellbooks or scrolls
- Train with mentors
- Experiment with new approaches
- Discover ancient magical traditions

### Spell Access by Tier

Suggested spell access progression:

**Character Creation:**
- All Cantrips
- 3-4 Standard Spells
- 1-2 Advanced Spells (if Sorcery +2 or higher)
- 0 Master Spells

**Milestone 2-3:**
- Gain 1-2 more Standard Spells
- Gain 1 Advanced Spell
- Possibly first Master Spell (if Sorcery +3)

**Milestone 4-5:**
- Full access to Standard/Advanced Spells
- Gain 1-2 Master Spells
- Specialize in preferred approaches

**Milestone 6+:**
- Access to all spell tiers
- Multiple Master Spells known
- Custom/signature spells

These are guidelines, not hard rules. GMs should adjust based on campaign needs.

## Magic and Narrative

### Magical Problem-Solving

Spells can solve problems outside combat:

**Encourage Creative Use:**
- Light for exploration
- Invisibility for infiltration
- Charm for social encounters
- Teleport for travel

**Maintain Challenge:**
- Not every problem has a spell solution
- Spell effects are temporary
- Casting is noticeable (usually)
- Resources are limited

**Example: Locked Door**
- No "knock" spell exists
- Could use Bolt to blast it (loud, generates opposition)
- Could use Charm on guard (social approach)
- Could use Invisibility to sneak past (doesn't solve door)
- Picking the lock is still valid

### Magic in Your World

Consider these worldbuilding questions:

**Prevalence:**
- How many people can cast? (Default: ~45% meet minimum)
- Are casters common or rare?
- Do non-casters fear magic?

**Regulation:**
- Are there magical authorities?
- Is magic legal everywhere?
- Are certain spells banned?

**Economy:**
- Can you buy magical services?
- How much does a healing spell cost?
- Are magic items available for purchase?

**Education:**
- How do casters learn?
- Are there magical schools?
- Is apprenticeship the norm?

**Traditions:**
- Which traditions exist in your world?
- Do they conflict or cooperate?
- Are there lost magical traditions?

These questions shape how magic feels in your game and create adventure opportunities.

## Magic and the Party

### Party Composition

**Multiple Spellcasters:**
- Encourage different approaches (one Mind, one Will, etc.)
- Create situations that reward variety
- Manage Flow economy carefully
- Avoid overlapping spell selections

**Mixed Party:**
- Martial characters generate Flow
- Casters spend Flow for impact
- Natural synergy in action economy
- Diverse problem-solving approaches

**No Spellcasters:**
- Game still works fine
- More reliance on skills and tactics
- Different narrative feel
- May want to adjust magic item availability

### Coordinated Casting

Multiple casters can coordinate:

**Sequential Casting:**
- One caster Shields, another attacks
- One caster creates advantage, another exploits
- Stagger resource expenditure
- Maintain Flow balance

**Complementary Approaches:**
- Mind caster provides precision
- Awareness caster provides damage
- Will caster provides reliability
- Presence caster provides social effects

**Concentration Stacking:**
- Multiple casters maintain different effects
- Create overlapping advantages
- Build defensive layers
- Overwhelming magical presence

## Edge Cases and Rulings

### Combining Magic with Other Abilities

**Archetype Abilities + Spells:**
- Most archetype abilities work with spells
- Fighter's weapon expertise doesn't apply to spell attacks
- Rogue's sneak attack doesn't work with spells (unless GM allows)
- Bard's inspiration affects spell rolls

**Skills + Spells:**
- Perform skill enhances Presence casting
- Arcana skill represents magical knowledge
- Stealth works with Invisibility
- Medicine complements Heal spell

### Counterspelling

**Dispel as Counter:**
- Ready action to Dispel when enemy casts
- Roll Dispel vs. enemy's casting roll
- Success negates their spell
- Costs your action and Flow

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Worth it for stopping Master Spells
- Less valuable vs. cantrips
- Mind Dispel calculates what to counter
- Will Dispel overpowers by force

### Magic and Death

**Healing the Dying:**
- Heal spell can restore dying characters
- Will-cast Heal works even at negative Flow
- Can cast even if you're dying (GM discretion)
- Narrative weight of saving someone

**Resurrection:**
- Not in base spell list
- If allowed, extremely expensive (Master Spell minimum)
- Require significant quest/sacrifice
- Narrative consequences for cheating death

*Magic in Flow RPG is designed to integrate seamlessly with every other system. Understanding these interactions creates richer tactical play and more compelling narratives.*




# Part II: The Four Casting Approaches


Deep dive into what makes each attribute approach unique and how to leverage their strengths.

# SPELLS - INTRODUCTION

## Core Magic Philosophy

### The Flow of Magic

Magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Flexible Casting System

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

### Tier 0: Cantrips (Generate +1 Flow on Success)
- Simple magics that build momentum rather than consuming it
- Successfully casting a cantrip generates +1 Flow
- Available to all casters from the start
- Examples: Spark, Light, Mage Armor, Prestidigitation

### Tier 1: Basic Spells (0 Flow Cost)
- Fundamental spells that maintain Flow equilibrium
- The bread and butter of magical combat and utility
- No Flow cost, making them reliable and sustainable
- Examples: Bolt, Shield, Charm, Blur, Detect Magic

### Tier 2: Advanced Spells (-1 Flow Cost)
- Powerful effects that require minimal momentum investment
- Moderate Flow cost enables frequent use
- Significant battlefield impact
- Examples: Fireball, Heal, Fly, Invisibility, Web

### Tier 3: Expert Spells (-2 Flow Cost)
- Major magical effects requiring significant focus
- Higher Flow investment for dramatic results
- Game-changing capabilities
- Examples: Lightning Bolt, Teleport, Polymorph, Scrying, Wall of Fire

### Tier 4: Master Spells (-3 Flow Cost)
- Reality-altering magic at the peak of mortal capability
- Requires substantial Flow but delivers legendary effects
- Can fundamentally change encounters
- Examples: Time Stop, Dominate, Meteor Swarm, True Resurrection, Wish

## Spells and Flow Generation

Spellcasters generate Flow through multiple methods, ensuring they participate actively in the Flow economy:

**Cantrips Generate Flow:**
- Successfully casting any cantrip generates +1 Flow
- This makes cantrips excellent for building momentum
- No Flow cost means you're always gaining when successful

**Aggressive Stance:**
- When you successfully cast an offensive spell that deals damage, gain +1 Flow
- Applies to all damage-dealing spells (Spark, Bolt, Fireball, etc.)
- Combines with cantrip Flow generation for Spark

**Taking Damage:**
- When you take damage (regardless of armor), gain +1 Flow
- Helps spellcasters recover from being targeted
- Universal Flow generation for all character types

**Critical Success:**
- Rolling 13+ on any casting roll generates +1 Flow
- Rewards high-skill casting

**Example Flow Economy:** A wizard casts Spark (cantrip) in Aggressive Stance and hits. They gain +1 Flow from cantrip success and +1 Flow from Aggressive successful attack, for a total of +2 Flow. Later, they cast Fireball (-1 Flow) and hit, spending 1 Flow but gaining 1 Flow back from Aggressive, for net 0 Flow cost.





# Part III: Cantrips - Fundamental Magic


Master the basics. Cantrips may be simple, but in skilled hands they're elegant solutions to countless problems.

# CANTRIPS (GENERATE +1 FLOW)

## Overview

Cantrips are simple magical effects that generate Flow rather than consuming it. Successfully casting a cantrip generates +1 Flow, making them excellent tools for building momentum. They represent the fundamental expressions of magical ability—small but reliable effects that any caster can produce indefinitely. While less powerful than standard spells, cantrips form the foundation of magical practice and remain useful throughout a caster's career as reliable Flow generators.

## Design Philosophy

Cantrips serve several purposes in the magic system:

1. **Flow Generation** - Build momentum through successful casting
2. **Baseline Action** - Casters always have something magical to do
3. **Combat Viability** - Effective even at 0 or negative Flow
4. **Narrative Flavor** - Shows constant magical ability
5. **Strategic Tool** - Generate Flow for more powerful spells

Even legendary archmages use cantrips—not only because they're free, but because they build the Flow needed for devastating master spells.

## Casting Cantrips

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute provides different benefits
- No Flow cost, but generates +1 Flow on success
- Still affected by armor penalties

**Success Thresholds:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Flow for enemy)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication, still generates +1 Flow)
- **10+:** Full success (described effect occurs, generates +1 Flow)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect, generates +2 Flow: +1 from cantrip, +1 from critical)

---

## SPARK

**Basic magical attack at Close range**

Spark represents the most fundamental offensive magic—a burst of pure magical energy directed at a target. It's the cantrip every combat caster relies on when conserving Flow or finishing weakened enemies.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Strike
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Precisely targeted (can avoid allies in melee)
- **Narrative:** Calculated trajectory, mathematical precision, no wasted energy
- **Tactical Use:** When allies are engaged with enemy, or need to avoid environmental hazards

### Awareness + Sorcery: Intuitive Blast
- **Damage:** 1d6 (+1 damage on 10+)
- **Special:** Can "feel" weak points for bonus damage
- **Narrative:** Instinctive aim, sensing vulnerabilities, natural magic
- **Tactical Use:** When maximum damage matters, even from a cantrip

### Will + Sorcery: Unyielding Force
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Can cast even at negative Flow
- **Narrative:** Powered by determination, channeled through sheer willpower, never fails you
- **Tactical Use:** When you're depleted but need to keep fighting

### Presence + Sorcery: Intimidating Display
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Target gets -1 to next action (fear effect)
- **Narrative:** Spectacular magical display, theatrical presentation, shows your power
- **Tactical Use:** When you want to demoralize as well as damage

### GM Notes
- Spark is the combat caster's bread and butter at 0 Flow
- Encourage players to describe their Spark attacks uniquely
- The debuff from Presence Spark doesn't stack with multiple hits
- At Close range, Spark works for melee casters

---

## LIGHT

**Illuminate area for scene**

Light creates magical illumination that lasts for a scene. It's one of the most universally useful cantrips, valuable in exploration, social situations, and even combat. Every adventuring caster learns Light early.

### Mind + Sorcery: Controlled Illumination
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Precise control—can dim/brighten, create patterns, focus beam
- **Narrative:** Mathematical light angles, calculated brightness, precise shapes
- **Tactical Use:** Spotlight specific areas, create signals, avoid alerting enemies

### Awareness + Sorcery: Revealing Radiance
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Can sense what light reveals (hidden doors, invisible creatures glow faintly)
- **Narrative:** Light that seeks truth, reveals hidden things, pierces illusions
- **Tactical Use:** Investigation, detecting hidden enemies, finding secret passages

### Will + Sorcery: Persistent Light
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Persists even in magical darkness
- **Narrative:** Unyielding light that refuses to be extinguished, powered by faith/will
- **Tactical Use:** Countering darkness effects, maintaining visibility in hostile conditions

### Presence + Sorcery: Dramatic Lighting
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Theatrical effects—colors, patterns, dramatic timing (+1 to Perform)
- **Narrative:** Stage lighting, impressive displays, emotion-evoking illumination
- **Tactical Use:** Social encounters, performances, intimidation through spectacle

### GM Notes
- Light lasts "a scene" (10-15 minutes typically)
- Can be cast on objects (coins, stones, weapons) for mobile light
- Multiple Light cantrips don't stack—use brightest one
- Magical darkness vs. Light is GM discretion (Will version automatically wins)

---

## MAGE ARMOR

**Protective barrier, self only**

Mage Armor creates a semi-tangible magical barrier that absorbs incoming damage. It's the defensive cantrip that keeps fragile casters alive. Unlike actual armor, it doesn't interfere with casting—making it the perfect protection for spellcasters.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Barrier
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 3 damage
- **Special:** Calculated angles optimize protection
- **Narrative:** Geometric force fields, perfect angles, mathematical deflection
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Awareness + Sorcery: Alert Shield
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Alerts you to incoming attacks (narrative warning)
- **Narrative:** Instinctive barrier that reacts to threats, sense danger before it hits
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Will + Sorcery: Stalwart Protection
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Maintains through concentration breaks and disruption
- **Narrative:** Unshakable barrier powered by determination, won't fail when needed
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Presence + Sorcery: Impressive Aegis
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Shimmers impressively, provides +1 to social rolls (shows your power)
- **Narrative:** Visible aura of magical protection, displays your magical prowess
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Important Rules
- **Doesn't Stack with Physical Armor:** Use whichever provides better Guard
- **Breaks After Absorbing Damage:** Once the absorbed damage is depleted, Guard bonus remains until end of scene
- **Can Be Recast:** Cast again once it breaks (still costs 0 Flow)
- **Self Only:** Cannot cast on allies (see Shield spell for protecting others)

### GM Notes
- Mage Armor is crucial for caster survivability
- The absorption is "first damage" per scene, not per hit
- Mind's 3 absorption vs. others' 2 is significant over time
- Presence version's social bonus makes you look mysteriously protected
- Breaking Mage Armor can be dramatic moment (barrier shatters!)

---

## Cantrip Tactics

### When to Use Cantrips

**Always Viable:**
- When Flow is low/negative
- Against weak enemies
- While building Flow in Defensive Stance
- When conserving resources

**Situational Choice:**
- Cantrip vs. Standard Spell depends on Flow state and needs
- Spark (+1 Flow) vs. Bolt (0 Flow) trades damage for Flow generation
- Cantrips build Flow while standard spells maintain it
- Consider cantrips when you need to build momentum for bigger spells

### Cantrip Combinations

**Mage Armor + Defensive Stance:**
- +2 Guard from armor, +2 Guard from stance = +4 total
- Build Flow while protected
- Very safe caster position
- Encourages aggression from enemies (good for party tactics)

**Spark + Aggressive Stance:**
- Attack with Spark (generates +1 Flow from cantrip)
- Aggressive stance adds +1 Flow on successful damage
- Total: +2 Flow per successful Spark attack
- Rapidly build Flow for bigger spells

**Light + Investigation:**
- Awareness Light reveals hidden things
- Combine with Search or Investigation skills
- No resource cost for thorough exploration
- Can maintain throughout investigation

### Cantrip Limitations

**What Cantrips Can't Do:**
- High damage (maximum 1d6 + modifier)
- Affect large areas (usually self or single target)
- Last beyond a scene (except Mage Armor effects)
- Replace standard+ spells for major effects

**Maintaining Balance:**
- Cantrips are useful but limited
- Don't let players trivialize challenges with cantrips
- Standard+ spells should feel more powerful
- Resource management (Flow) remains important

---

## Custom Cantrips

GMs may allow custom cantrips following these guidelines:

**Power Level:**
- Damage: Maximum 1d6 + attribute
- Defense: Maximum +2 Guard or absorb 2-3 damage
- Duration: Scene maximum
- Range: Close to Near typically
- Targets: Self or single target

**Design Template:**

**[Cantrip Name] - [Basic Description]**

- **Mind:** [Precision/control benefit]
- **Awareness:** [Instinct/sensing benefit]
- **Will:** [Reliability/persistence benefit]
- **Presence:** [Social/dramatic benefit]

**Example Custom Cantrip: Frost Touch**
- **Mind:** 1d6 cold damage, target slowed (calculated application)
- **Awareness:** 1d6 cold damage, sense target's body heat (instinctive)
- **Will:** 1d6 cold damage, works at negative Flow (reliable)
- **Presence:** 1d6 cold damage, creates frost patterns (+1 intimidate)

---

## Narrative Uses for Cantrips

Beyond mechanical effects, cantrips show magical nature:

**Social Situations:**
- Light a candle with Spark (show off)
- Create mood lighting with Light (impress)
- Mage Armor shimmer hints at power (intimidate)
- Casual cantrip use shows experience

**Exploration:**
- Light for safe exploration
- Spark to test for gas/explosive atmosphere
- Mage Armor before dangerous threshold
- Awareness cantrips to sense magic

**Downtime:**
- Teaching cantrips to apprentices
- Practicing new attribute approaches
- Experimenting with effects
- Showing magical nature to non-casters

**Atmospheric Moments:**
- Elderly wizard lights his pipe with Spark
- Nervous young caster's Mage Armor flickers
- Confident sorcerer maintains constant Light around them
- Bard uses Light to create theatrical effects

---

*Cantrips may be simple magic, but in the hands of a skilled caster, they become elegant solutions to countless problems. Never underestimate the power of free magic.*




# Part IV: Standard Spells - Reliable Magic


Standard spells are the bread and butter of magical practice. Efficient, effective, and essential.

# TIER 1: BASIC SPELLS (0 FLOW)

## Overview

Tier 1 spells represent the fundamental magical effects that all casters rely on. Costing 0 Flow, these spells maintain Flow equilibrium—making them sustainable and reliable for regular use. They provide significantly more power than cantrips while remaining accessible even at low Flow. A well-chosen basic spell at the right moment can turn the tide of an encounter without depleting your resources.

## Design Philosophy

Basic spells occupy the foundational tier in the magic system:

1. **Sustainable Use** - No Flow cost means unlimited casting potential
2. **Meaningful Impact** - Significantly more powerful than cantrips
3. **Tactical Variety** - Different spells for different situations
4. **Flow Neutral** - Maintain your Flow state while producing powerful effects
5. **Combat Staple** - The bread and butter of magical combat

Experienced casters use basic spells as their primary magical tool, building Flow with cantrips and spending it on advanced/master spells for critical moments.

- **Not Mind Control:** Even Will version has limits (won't jump off cliff)

### GM Notes
- Charm is powerful but requires careful adjudication
- Will version is closest to true mind control
- Mind and Presence are subtler, more social
- Awareness version is information-gathering
- Can't make targets do things fundamentally against their nature
- May break if you attack charmed target

---

## BLUR

**Defensive obscurement, self only**

Blur makes you harder to hit by distorting your appearance. Whether through calculated probability manipulation, instinctive dodging, unshakable determination, or mesmerizing movements, Blur provides excellent defense for a modest Flow cost.

### Mind + Sorcery: Probability Distortion
- **Effect:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Range:** Self
- **Special:** Calculated probability manipulation (attacks miss by impossible coincidence)
- **Narrative:** Statistical improbability, calculated evasion, perfect timing
- **Duration:** Scene

### Awareness + Sorcery: Precognitive Dodge
- **Effect:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Range:** Self
- **Special:** Instinctively dodge before attacks land (start moving before enemy swings)
- **Narrative:** See attacks coming, sense danger, reactive instinct
- **Duration:** Scene

### Will + Sorcery: Unshakable Form
- **Effect:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Range:** Self
- **Special:** Maintain even when stunned, dazed, or disrupted
- **Narrative:** Refuse to be hit, determination manifests as protection
- **Duration:** Scene

### Presence + Sorcery: Mesmerizing Motion
- **Effect:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Range:** Self
- **Special:** Distracting movements confuse attackers (they aim wrong)
- **Narrative:** Hypnotic movements, theatrical flourishes, captivating presence
- **Duration:** Scene

### Important Rules
- **Self Only:** Cannot cast on allies (use Shield for that)
- **Stacks with Guard:** +2 is additional defense
- **Lasts Scene:** Very efficient protection
- **Works with Mage Armor/Shield:** Can layer defenses

### GM Notes
- Blur + Shield + Mage Armor = very well-protected caster
- +2 defense is significant (approximately +33% survival)
- Will version working through disruption is unique advantage
- All versions are mechanically similar (choose for narrative)
- Different descriptions for each attribute make same bonus feel different

# Part V: Advanced Spells - Powerful Magic


Advanced spells can change the course of an encounter. These are the spells players remember.

# ADVANCED & EXPERT SPELLS (TIER 2 & 3)

## Overview

This document covers both Tier 2 (Advanced) and Tier 3 (Expert) spells—powerful magic that can change the course of an encounter. These spells require Flow investment but deliver game-changing effects. When a caster reaches for an advanced spell, everyone at the table knows something significant is about to happen.

## Design Philosophy

Advanced and Expert spells occupy the high-impact tiers:

1. **Decisive Moments** - Turn the tide of combat or solve major problems
2. **Resource Investment** - Flow cost demands strategic timing
3. **Memorable Magic** - These are the spells players remember
4. **Scaling Power** - Dramatically more powerful than basic spells
5. **Tactical Depth** - Each tier offers different power-to-cost ratios

Experienced casters build toward these spells, managing Flow to enable powerful effects when they matter most.

## Spell Tiers

### Tier 2: Advanced Spells (-1 Flow)
**Examples:** Fireball, Heal, Fly, Invisibility, Web

Moderate Flow investment for significant battlefield impact. These spells are accessible enough to use regularly once you've built some Flow through cantrips or basic spells.

### Tier 3: Expert Spells (-2 Flow)
**Examples:** Lightning Bolt, Teleport, Polymorph, Scrying, Wall of Fire

Higher Flow investment for dramatic results and game-changing capabilities. Reserved for critical moments or when you've built substantial Flow.

## Casting These Spells

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery

- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute provides dramatically different benefits
- Flow cost varies by spell tier
- Still affected by armor penalties

**Success Thresholds:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Flow for enemy, lose Flow cost anyway)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication)
- **10+:** Full success (described effect occurs in full glory)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect plus +1 Flow)

---

# TIER 2: ADVANCED SPELLS (-1 FLOW)

---

## FIREBALL

**Area damage spell**

Fireball is the iconic area damage spell—a roiling sphere of magical flame that detonates across a zone, catching multiple enemies. It's the spell every combat caster dreams of using, and for good reason: properly timed, Fireball can end encounters decisively.

### Mind + Sorcery: Precision Detonation
- **Damage:** 2d6 + Mind to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Exclude X targets from blast (X = Mind attribute)
- **Narrative:** Calculated blast wave, mathematical precision, controlled detonation
- **Tactical Use:** Hitting enemies without harming allies in melee
- **Example:** Mind +3 can exclude 3 targets from the explosion

### Awareness + Sorcery: Maximum Blast
- **Damage:** 2d6 + Awareness to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Absolute maximum damage output
- **Narrative:** Instinctive power release, feels for maximum effect, overwhelming force
- **Tactical Use:** Pure damage when ally positioning doesn't matter
- **Example:** Awareness +3 deals 2d6+3 to everyone in zone

### Will + Sorcery: Unyielding Inferno
- **Damage:** 2d6 + Will to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Can cast at negative Flow
- **Narrative:** Channeled through sheer determination, powered by faith/will, never fails
- **Tactical Use:** Desperation Fireball when depleted
- **Example:** At -2 Flow, can still cast (ends at -5 Flow)

### Presence + Sorcery: Terrifying Conflagration
- **Damage:** 2d6 + Presence to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Survivors must flee or cower (morale break)
- **Narrative:** Apocalyptic display, psychologically devastating, shows overwhelming power
- **Tactical Use:** Damage + battlefield control through terror
- **Example:** Weaker enemies flee, stronger enemies shaken

### Important Rules
- **Zone Effect:** Affects entire combat zone (typically 3-6 targets)
- **No Friendly Fire:** Except Mind version which excludes specific targets
- **Environmental Effects:** Might ignite flammable materials, create smoke
- **Flow Cost:** -1 Flow (Tier 2 spell)

### GM Notes
- Fireball is THE iconic spell—make it feel awesome
- Mind's exclusion allows "party Fireball" (allies in blast zone)
- Awareness + high attribute = devastating damage
- Presence's terror effect can end encounters without killing everyone
- Consider environment: Fireball in a wooden building has consequences
- Multiple enemy groups = multiple zones = multiple Fireballs needed

---

## HEAL

**Restore health to target**

Heal channels magical energy to repair injuries, restore vitality, and save lives. It's the most important spell in any support caster's arsenal, capable of bringing allies back from the brink of death.

- **Tactical Use:** Healing + morale boost

- **Multiple Castings:** Can heal same target multiple times
- **Flow Cost:** -1 Flow (Tier 2 spell)

### GM Notes
- Heal changes survival math significantly
- Will version letting dying casters save allies is heroic
- Mind's diagnosis can be adventure hook (rare poison!)
- Presence version's inspiration is narrative but meaningful
- Touch range means healer must be in danger zone
- Consider allowing Heal to cure diseases/poisons at GM discretion

---

## INVISIBILITY

**Concealment for scene**

---

## DISPEL

**Counter or remove magic**

Dispel is the anti-magic spell, capable of countering enemy spells or removing magical effects. It's the caster's answer to hostile magic, and different attributes approach dispelling in dramatically different ways.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Unweaving

Expert spells require higher Flow investment but deliver game-changing results. These spells include Lightning Bolt, Teleport, Polymorph, Scrying, and Wall of Fire.

**Note:** Full details for Tier 3 spells will be added in future updates. For now, GMs should treat these as more powerful versions of Tier 2 effects with -2 Flow cost and increased impact.

# Part VI: Master Spells - Legendary Magic


Master spells are the pinnacle of magical power. When these spells are cast, legends are born.

# TIER 4: MASTER SPELLS (-3 FLOW)

## Overview

Master spells represent the pinnacle of magical power—legendary effects that reshape battles, alter reality, and create moments that become campaign legends. Costing 3 Flow, these spells are significant investments that deliver correspondingly massive results. When a master spell is cast, the entire table stops to witness the awesome display of power.

## Design Philosophy

Master spells define the apex of the magic system:

1. **Legendary Moments** - These spells become campaign-defining stories
2. **Significant Investment** - 3 Flow represents half of maximum Flow capacity
3. **Reality-Bending** - Effects that seem impossible at lower tiers
4. **Strategic Climaxes** - Cast at decisive moments when you've built substantial Flow
5. **Accessible Power** - Reduced cost makes them achievable in extended combats

Master spells aren't for everyday use—they're for the moments when everything is on the line and only overwhelming magical power will suffice. The rebalanced cost makes them achievable goals rather than once-per-campaign events.

## Casting Master Spells

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
**Flow Cost:** -3 Flow (must have at least 3 Flow, except Will approach)

- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute creates fundamentally different expressions of power
- Significant resource investment—requires building Flow through cantrips and combat
- Still affected by armor penalties
- Combine with Aggressive stance to partially recover cost on damage spells

**Success Thresholds:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Flow for enemy, lose 3 Flow anyway—costly)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication—still impressive)
- **10+:** Full success (legendary effect unfolds as described)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect plus +1 Flow recovered)

---

## LIGHTNING STORM

**Massive area attack**

Lightning Storm summons a tempest of electrical fury that strikes multiple zones simultaneously. It's the master-tier answer to overwhelming numbers—when enemies surround you on all sides, call down the thunder and reshape the battlefield with apocalyptic force.

- **Range:** Far (all zones in sight)

- **Flow Cost:** At 5 Flow, this is usually your entire pool

### GM Notes
- Lightning Storm is **THE** big damage spell
- Mind's targeting allows "friendly storm" (allies unharmed)
- Awareness automatically spares allies (instinctively knows them)
- Will's sustained effect is incredibly powerful (3d6 per turn for scene!)

- Aftermath should be visible (scorched earth, terrified survivors)

- **Example:** Grab the villain and teleport them to jail (opposed Will roll)

### Presence + Sorcery: Dramatic Arrival
- **Effect:** Teleport with theatrical timing
- **Range:** Based on knowledge of destination
- **Special:** +3 to next Social action, impossibly perfect timing
- **Narrative:** Arrive at the perfect dramatic moment, theatrical entrance/exit
- **Tactical Use:** Social encounters, inspiring appearances, dramatic rescue
- **Example:** Appear as villain is monologuing: "I don't think so."

### Important Rules
- **Familiar Destination:** GM determines if destination is "known enough"
- **Passengers:** Can bring willing creatures (number = attribute)
- **Carrying Capacity:** Normal carrying limits apply
- **Teleport Failure:** Failing this spell is dangerous (GM discretion: off-target, scattered, damage)

### GM Notes
- Teleport can break adventures if overused
- Establish limitations early (must have been there, need coordinates, etc.)
- Failure should be consequential (end up in ocean, inside rock, etc.)
- Mind version is most versatile (anywhere calculable)
- Awareness requires sensory connection (most restrictive)
- Will forcing others enables kidnapping (very powerful)
- Presence enables perfect timing (arrive exactly when dramatic)
- Consider: Teleport wards, blocked locations, magical interference
- Use for awesome moments: dramatic rescue, triumphant arrival, desperate escape

## DOMINATE

**Control target's actions**

Dominate seizes control of another creature's mind and body, forcing them to act according to your will. It's the ultimate social/control spell—the apex of mind-affecting magic that turns enemies into puppets, allies into champions, or bystanders into tools.

### Mind + Sorcery: Logical Compulsion
- **Effect:** Commands seem reasonable to target
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Target rationalizes your commands as their own ideas
- **Narrative:** Plant logical-seeming motivations, rewrite their reasoning, "of course I should do this"
- **Tactical Use:** Subtle control, target doesn't realize they're dominated
- **Example:** "You should tell me the password" becomes target's idea

### Awareness + Sorcery: Sensory Possession
- **Effect:** Sense and use target's skills and knowledge
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Access their memories, skills, knowledge while controlling them
- **Narrative:** Ride their senses, feel what they feel, know what they know
- **Tactical Use:** Information extraction + control
- **Example:** Force guard to give password while learning fortress layout

### Will + Sorcery: Absolute Control
- **Effect:** Complete control if your Will exceeds theirs
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Total domination of weaker-willed targets, they become extensions of your will
- **Narrative:** Overpower their volition, force absolute obedience, unshakable command
- **Tactical Use:** Perfect control of weak-willed enemies
- **Example:** Will +3 vs. target's Will +1 = complete puppet

### Presence + Sorcery: Devoted Servant
- **Effect:** Target believes they want to serve you
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene (may persist longer)
- **Special:** Target enthusiastically serves, convinced of your greatness
- **Narrative:** Become their idol, they worship you, zealous service
- **Tactical Use:** Create temporary fanatic ally
- **Example:** Enemy captain becomes fervent devotee mid-battle

### Important Rules
- **Strong-Willed Targets:** High Will provides resistance
- **Opposed Roll:** Target can resist (their Will + d6 vs. your cast)
- **Scene Duration:** Default, but effects may linger
- **Moral Implications:** This is mind control—players and characters may object
- **Suicidal Commands:** Won't work (jump off cliff, stab self, etc.)

### GM Notes
- Dominate is powerful and morally complex
- Discuss boundaries in Session Zero
- Mind version is subtlest (target doesn't know)
- Awareness lets you rifle through memories (interrogation)
- Will version is classic mind control (absolute when it works)
- Presence creates genuine devotion (scariest version?)
- Set difficulty: Weak-willed NPC = auto, Strong-willed = opposed, Legendary = may be immune
- Duration: "Scene" default, but Presence may cause lasting loyalty
- Moral weight: This is violation—NPCs and PCs may react strongly
- Consider: Detect Magic reveals domination, Dispel can free victims

## TIME STOP

**Pause time briefly**

Time Stop is the ultimate tactical spell—the ability to freeze the flow of time itself, granting you freedom to act while the world stands still. It's the spell of desperate gambits, perfect positioning, and dramatic monologues. When time stops, only you remain in motion.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Chronostasis
- **Effect:** Calculate optimal actions, take 3 full turns
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment"
- **Special:** Plan and execute perfect sequence of actions
- **Narrative:** Mathematical time manipulation, calculate optimal timeline, perfect positioning
- **Tactical Use:** Set up perfect tactical situation
- **Example:** Move into position, cast buffs, prepare ambush—then time resumes

### Awareness + Sorcery: Temporal Awareness
- **Effect:** React to everything simultaneously, interrupt any action
- **Range:** Self + perception range
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment"
- **Special:** Perceive and respond to all threats/opportunities at once
- **Narrative:** Sense all possible futures, instinctive perfect timing, awareness beyond time
- **Tactical Use:** Perfect reaction, counter anything
- **Example:** Enemy casts spell—you stop time, Dispel it, move away—time resumes, spell fails

### Will + Sorcery: Extended Chronostasis
- **Effect:** Extend duration through force of will
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment" or longer with concentration
- **Special:** Maintain time stop as long as you concentrate
- **Narrative:** Refuse to let time flow, force moment to persist, unshakable temporal control
- **Tactical Use:** Take as many actions as needed
- **Example:** Stop time, search entire room, find hidden item, read documents, return to position

### Presence + Sorcery: Dramatic Monologue
- **Effect:** Time for perfect dramatic speech
- **Range:** Self + audience
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment"
- **Special:** Deliver speech/performance while time is frozen, guaranteed social impact when time resumes
- **Narrative:** Theatrical time stop, dramatic reveal, captive audience
- **Tactical Use:** Guaranteed social effect, perfect timing for reveal
- **Example:** Stop time, walk through frozen battle explaining villain's plan, resume time with +3 to Social

### Important Rules
- **Actions During Time Stop:** Can't directly harm frozen creatures (but can position, buff, etc.)
- **No Damage Dealing:** Attacks during time stop don't deal damage (or all resolve when time resumes)
- **Positioning:** Can move freely, position perfectly
- **Preparation:** Can cast buffs, drink potions, prepare actions
- **Interaction:** Can't interrogate frozen people or read minds

### GM Notes
- Time Stop is narratively powerful but has limits
- Prevent infinite loops: set maximum benefit
- Mind: 3 turns of buffing/positioning
- Awareness: Perfect counter to one action
- Will: Extended but not infinite (GM discretion)
- Presence: Social action, not combat exploit
- Can't use Time Stop to kill helpless enemies (anti-climactic)
- Best uses: escape impossible situations, perfect positioning, dramatic moments
- Consider: Some beings may be immune (time elementals, gods)
- This is the "I WIN" button—use sparingly
- Make it feel awesome when cast
- Balance: Costs 5 Flow (huge investment)

# Part VII: Magical Traditions


Explore the cultural and narrative frameworks that shape how magic is practiced.

# MAGIC SYSTEM

### The Flow of Magic

In this world, magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Magic Access Requirements

Not everyone can cast spells. To access magic, a character must have:

- **Mind + Awareness ≥ +2** total
- This represents the minimum mental acuity and perceptual awareness needed to sense and manipulate magical Flow
- Approximately 45% of the population meets this requirement
- Even Wizards, Clerics, and Bards must meet this requirement!

This requirement creates meaningful attribute choices without being overly restrictive. Failing to meet the requirement doesn't mean you can never cast—you can increase these attributes through milestones.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

---

### Core Mechanic

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute. Instead:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

### Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells imposes penalties:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

Certain species traits and abilities can reduce these penalties, like the Elven Focus trait that ignores the first point of armor penalty.

### Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

---

## Enchanted Items

Magical items in this system interact with the Flow economy in various ways:

### Types of Enchanted Items

**Flow Batteries**
- Store Flow points for later use
- Typically have a capacity of 1-3 Flow
- Recharge between scenes or through specific actions

**Spell Catalysts**
- Reduce Flow cost of specific spells by 1 (minimum 0)
- Often tied to a specific casting attribute
- Example: "Mind Lens: When casting with Mind, reduce Bolt cost by 1 Flow"

**Attribute Enhancers**
- Temporarily boost a specific attribute for spellcasting
- Don't affect other uses of the attribute
- Example: "Awareness Amulet: +1 Awareness when casting spells"

**Stance Anchors**
- Maintain a spell's effect even when changing stances
- Normally, some spell effects might end when changing stances
- Example: "Sentinel Ring: Maintain one defensive spell when switching stances"

### Using Enchanted Items

- Most require attunement (conscious connection to the item)
- Characters can typically attune to a number of items equal to their Will attribute (minimum 1)
- Using an item's power generally requires an action unless specified otherwise
- Some items have limited charges or uses per scene/day

---

### Which Attribute When?

**Use Mind when:**
- Precision targeting is crucial
- Allies are mixed with enemies
- You need to understand complex magical interactions
- Controlled, calculated effects are more important than raw power

**Use Awareness when:**
- Maximum damage is the priority

- You're in unfamiliar magical territory

**Use Will when:**
- You're at negative Flow but need to cast anyway
- Maintaining concentration under duress is important
- You need to push through resistance or counterspells
- Reliability matters more than optimization

**Use Presence when:**
- Social effects should accompany the magic
- Intimidation or inspiration is tactically useful
- Multiple targets need to be influenced
- The appearance of the spell matters as much as its effect

### Magic in Combat Stances

**Aggressive Stance Magic**
- Focus on damaging spells
- Mind for precision targeting
- Awareness for maximum damage
- Can generate Flow from successful offensive spells

**Balanced Stance Magic**
- Versatile, adaptive casting
- Good for utility spells
- Can quickly switch to other stances for specific effects

**Defensive Stance Magic**
- Protective and reactive spells
- Will casting for concentration
- Mage Sight is enhanced in this stance
- Good position for setting up complex spells

# Part VIII: Running Magic (For GMs)


Guidance for Game Masters on balancing magic, adjudicating spells, and creating magical encounters.

# SPELLS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Magic in Your Game

Magic in Flow RPG is designed to be both mechanically elegant and narratively rich. This guide helps you leverage the flexible casting system to create memorable magical moments while maintaining balance and pacing.

## Interpreting Attribute-Based Casting

### Encouraging Player Creativity

The four-attribute casting system gives players tremendous creative freedom. As GM, your role is to:

1. **Honor the Narrative** - Let players describe HOW they're casting with their chosen attribute
2. **Enforce the Mechanics** - Apply the mechanical benefits consistently
3. **Celebrate Variety** - Encourage players to switch attributes based on situations
4. **Maintain Balance** - Don't let one attribute dominate all situations

### Example Rulings

**Player:** "I want to cast Bolt with Presence to intimidate the bandit leader."
**GM Response:** "Great! The bolt will do Presence + d6 damage, and if you hit, the spectacular display will cause fear. Roll for the attack, and we'll see how the bandits react to your show of force."

**Player:** "Can I cast Heal with Mind to diagnose what's wrong with the poisoned merchant?"
**GM Response:** "Absolutely. You'll restore Mind + d6 Vitality, and your analytical approach will let you identify the specific poison. This might give you advantage on finding an antidote."

### When to Say No

Sometimes a player's interpretation doesn't fit the attribute benefits. Guide them gently:

**Player:** "I cast Fireball with Mind and want it to do maximum damage."
**GM:** "Mind gives you precision and control—you can exclude allies from the blast. If you want maximum damage, that's the Awareness approach. Which would you prefer?"

## Balancing Magic in Combat

### Flow Economy Management

Magic is balanced through the Flow economy. As GM, you can:

1. **Control Starting Flow** - Tougher encounters might start with characters at lower Flow
2. **Manage Enemy Actions** - Enemies that generate opponent Flow can limit spellcasting
3. **Vary Encounter Length** - Longer fights strain spellcaster resources
4. **Create Anti-Magic Zones** - Areas where casting is difficult or impossible

### Spellcaster-Heavy Parties

If your party has multiple spellcasters:

- Design encounters that reward different casting approaches
- Include enemies with high Guard (favoring Mind's precision) and low Guard (favoring Awareness's damage)
- Create social encounters where Presence casting shines
- Include situations where Will casting's reliability becomes crucial

### Non-Spellcaster Balance

Ensure martial characters remain relevant:

- Magic costs Flow, weapon attacks often generate it
- Positioning and zone control matter more than pure damage
- Some enemies resist magic but are vulnerable to physical attacks
- Martial characters are more consistent turn-to-turn

## Magical Traditions in Your World

### Using the Four Traditions

The spell system includes four cultural traditions (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md)):

1. **Arcane Academies** (Mind)
2. **Wild Talent** (Awareness)
3. **Divine Channeling** (Will)
4. **Performance Magic** (Presence)

These are narrative frameworks, not mechanical restrictions. Use them to:

- Create faction conflicts (Academy vs. Wild Mages)
- Develop quest hooks (recover stolen holy relic)
- Build setting detail (famous Bard colleges)
- Establish NPC backgrounds

### Custom Traditions

Feel free to create your own magical traditions:

**Example: Blood Magic**
- Primary Attribute: Will or Awareness
- Focus Items: Ritual daggers, blood vials
- Philosophy: Magic powered by life force
- Mechanical Hook: Can spend Vitality instead of Flow for spells

**Example: Rune Magic**
- Primary Attribute: Mind
- Focus Items: Carved stones, inscribed items
- Philosophy: Magic bound into permanent forms
- Mechanical Hook: Prepare spells in advance, cast without roll

Keep custom traditions narratively distinct but mechanically compatible with the core system.

## Handling Edge Cases

### Casting at Negative Flow

Will-based casting allows casting at negative Flow. Guidelines:

1. **It's a Feature, Not a Bug** - This is the Will caster's strength
2. **Narrative Consequences** - Going deeply negative might anger a deity/patron
3. **Recovery Takes Time** - Negative Flow recovers slowly (see [02_system_integration.md](02_system_integration.md))
4. **Physical Toll** - Describe the strain of channeling power when depleted

### Multi-Target Spells

Some spell benefits affect "zones" or "all enemies." Rulings:

1. **Define Zones Clearly** - Use the zone system (Close/Near/Far)
2. **Reasonable Limits** - "All enemies" means those in the affected zone(s)
3. **Mind Precision** - Mind casting can exclude allies from area effects
4. **Narrative Scale** - Describe the awesome scope of large-area spells

### Concentration and Stance Changes

Some spell effects "maintain for scene." Guidelines:

1. **Default Rule** - Effects persist through stance changes unless disruptive
2. **GM Judgment** - Particularly disruptive actions might break concentration
3. **Will Advantage** - Will casting specifically maintains through disruption
4. **Stance Anchors** - Magic items can protect effects (see enchanted items)

## Creating Magical Encounters

### Spellcaster Enemies

When designing enemy spellcasters:

1. **Choose Primary Attribute** - Pick one or two attributes they prefer
2. **Select Appropriate Spells** - Match spell tier to enemy threat level
3. **Consider Flow Economy** - Enemy casters need Flow too
4. **Tactical Behavior** - Show smart casting choices to teach players

**Example: Bandit Wizard**
- Attributes: Mind +2, others +0
- Spells: Bolt (Mind for precision), Shield (Mind for calculated defense)
- Tactics: Stays at Far range, uses Mind to avoid hitting allies
- Flow: Starts at 2-3 Flow, conserves for key moments

**Example: Wild Sorcerer**
- Attributes: Awareness +3, others +0
- Spells: Spark, Bolt, Fireball (all Awareness for maximum damage)
- Tactics: Aggressive, burns Flow quickly for big damage
- Flow: Starts at 4 Flow, goes negative if desperate

### Anti-Magic Challenges

Not every encounter should favor magic. Create variety:

1. **Silence Zones** - Areas where spells can't be cast
2. **Magic-Resistant Enemies** - High bonuses to resist/dodge spells
3. **Counterspelling Foes** - Enemies that can Dispel aggressively
4. **Social Encounters** - Where blasting isn't an option

### Magic-Friendly Scenarios

Sometimes, let spellcasters shine:

1. **Puzzle Encounters** - Where specific spells provide solutions
2. **Investigation Scenes** - Mage Sight and detection spells excel
3. **Mob Combat** - Area spells handle many weak enemies
4. **Dramatic Moments** - Big spell at climactic time

## Enchanted Items and Magic

### Distributing Magical Items

Enchanted items interact with the Flow economy (see [spell_tiers/](spell_tiers/) for item types):

1. **Flow Batteries** - Extend spellcaster staying power
2. **Spell Catalysts** - Make specific spells more efficient
3. **Attribute Enhancers** - Improve casting effectiveness
4. **Stance Anchors** - Provide tactical flexibility

**Balance Guidelines:**
- 1 minor item per character by Milestone 2
- 1 moderate item per character by Milestone 4
- 1 major item per character by Milestone 6
- Legendary items are extremely rare campaign rewards

### Attunement Limits

Characters can attune to items equal to their Will (minimum 1):

- Low Will characters must choose which items to use
- High Will characters can leverage more magical gear
- Creates meaningful choice for martial vs. magical items
- Temporary attunement changes take a full scene

### Creating Custom Magic Items

When designing custom magical items:

1. **Tie to Flow Economy** - Items should interact with Flow
2. **Support Playstyle** - Match items to character approaches
3. **Avoid "Must Haves"** - Don't create items every character needs
4. **Narrative Significance** - Give items history and meaning

**Example Custom Item: Stormcaller's Baton**
- Category: Spell Catalyst
- Effect: Reduce cost of lightning/storm spells by 1 Flow
- Requires: Attunement
- Story: Carved from a tree struck by lightning during a legendary duel

## Adjudicating Spell Effects

### Spell Descriptions as Guidelines

The spell entries provide mechanical frameworks, but:

1. **Allow Creative Applications** - Players will find clever uses
2. **Maintain Mechanical Boundaries** - Don't let spells do everything
3. **Rule Consistently** - Once you allow something, it sets precedent
4. **Discuss Intent** - Understand what players want to accomplish

### The "10-Foot Rule"

If players try to use cantrips to trivialize challenges:

1. **Narrative Limits** - Cantrips are minor magic
2. **Time Constraints** - Some solutions take too long
3. **Imperfect Solutions** - Cantrip fixes are temporary
4. **Encourage Resourcefulness** - But don't shut down creativity

**Example:**
**Player:** "I use Light repeatedly to search the entire dungeon safely."
**GM:** "Light lasts a scene, so you can explore one area at a time. The dungeon is large enough that fully searching it will take days. What's your approach?"

## Common GM Questions

### "Can I limit spells in my game?"

Yes, but carefully:

- Communicate restrictions during Session Zero
- Have narrative justification (magic is illegal, rare, etc.)
- Ensure restrictions apply equally to NPCs
- Consider offering alternative options

### "What if a player only uses one attribute?"

This is fine! It's a valid specialization:

- They'll excel in some situations
- They'll struggle in others
- Other party members will complement them
- They might diversify as they gain milestones

### "How many spells should a character know?"

The system doesn't strictly limit known spells:

- Narrative limits (spellbook size, learned prayers, etc.) are fine
- Consider: All cantrips + 3 spells per tier at creation
- Learn new spells through play (finding scrolls, training, etc.)
- Higher-tier spells are automatically more limited by Flow cost

### "Should I use spell slots instead of Flow?"

The Flow system is core to the game's design:

- Flow creates dynamic pacing
- It unifies magic, combat, and narrative momentum
- Slots would require significant system redesign
- If you prefer slots, consider another system

## Session Zero Discussions

Before starting your campaign, discuss:

1. **Magic Prevalence** - How common is magic in your world?
2. **Tradition Importance** - Do traditions matter mechanically or just narratively?
3. **Item Availability** - How easy is it to find/buy magical items?
4. **House Rules** - Any modifications to spell rules?
5. **Player Expectations** - What kind of magical experience do players want?

*Use these guidelines as a framework, not a straightjacket. The best ruling is the one that keeps your game moving, honors the fiction, and ensures everyone has fun.*

Advanced tactics for maximizing your effectiveness as a spellcaster.

# MAGIC SYSTEM

### The Flow of Magic

In this world, magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Magic Access Requirements

Not everyone can cast spells. To access magic, a character must have:

- **Mind + Awareness ≥ +2** total
- This represents the minimum mental acuity and perceptual awareness needed to sense and manipulate magical Flow
- Approximately 45% of the population meets this requirement
- Even Wizards, Clerics, and Bards must meet this requirement!

This requirement creates meaningful attribute choices without being overly restrictive. Failing to meet the requirement doesn't mean you can never cast—you can increase these attributes through milestones.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

---

### Core Mechanic

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute. Instead:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

### Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells imposes penalties:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

Certain species traits and abilities can reduce these penalties, like the Elven Focus trait that ignores the first point of armor penalty.

### Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

- Example: "Sentinel Ring: Maintain one defensive spell when switching stances"

### Using Enchanted Items

- Most require attunement (conscious connection to the item)
- Characters can typically attune to a number of items equal to their Will attribute (minimum 1)
- Using an item's power generally requires an action unless specified otherwise
- Some items have limited charges or uses per scene/day

### Which Attribute When?

**Use Mind when:**
- Precision targeting is crucial

- You're in unfamiliar magical territory

**Use Will when:**
- You're at negative Flow but need to cast anyway

- You need to push through resistance or counterspells
- Reliability matters more than optimization

**Use Presence when:**
- Social effects should accompany the magic
- Intimidation or inspiration is tactically useful
- Multiple targets need to be influenced
- The appearance of the spell matters as much as its effect

### Magic in Combat Stances

**Aggressive Stance Magic**
- Focus on damaging spells
- Mind for precision targeting
- Awareness for maximum damage
- Can generate Flow from successful offensive spells

**Balanced Stance Magic**
- Versatile, adaptive casting
- Good for utility spells
