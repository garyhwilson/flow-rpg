# Introduction: Using This Manual


The Flow RPG Monster Manual provides Game Masters with a comprehensive collection of creatures, adversaries, and NPCs to populate their campaigns. Each entry is designed for easy use at the table while maintaining the tactical depth that makes Flow RPG combats engaging.

# MONSTERS & NPCS - INTRODUCTION

## Overview

Monsters and NPCs in Flow RPG are designed using the same Flow economy that drives player characters. This creates dynamic, engaging encounters where every action matters and the tactical interplay between players and adversaries flows naturally from the core mechanics.

## Design Philosophy

### Flow-Based Balance

Monsters aren't balanced by hit points and damage—they're balanced by their relationship to the Flow economy:

- **Minions** generate Flow for players through easy defeats
- **Standard enemies** create balanced Flow exchanges
- **Champions** challenge players' Flow management
- **Legendary adversaries** force critical resource decisions

### Simple but Tactical

Monster stat blocks are intentionally streamlined:
- **Easy to run** at the table
- **Clear motivations** drive tactical decisions
- **Interesting abilities** without excessive complexity
- **Scalable** through simple modifications

### Integrated with Core Systems

Monsters work with the same rules as PCs:
- Use the same Flow economy
- Follow stance rules (when applicable)
- Cast spells using the flexible system
- Interact with all PC abilities naturally

---

## Threat Levels

Monsters are categorized by threat level, which determines their role in encounters and relationship to the Flow economy.

---

## Monster Stat Block Template

All monsters use this standardized format:

```

Range: [Close/Near/Far]
Special: [Any special properties]

ABILITIES
[Ability Name] (Cost: X Flow)
[Description and mechanics]

TACTICS
[How the monster fights, key strategies]

FLAVOR
[Description, behavior, motivation]
```

---

## Quick Monster Creation

To create a monster quickly:

### 1. Choose Threat Level
Determines baseline stats and Flow

### 2. Set Core Stats
- **Vitality:** Threat 1 = 3-6, Threat 2 = 8-12, Threat 3 = 14-20, Threat 4 = 25-40+
- **Guard:** Threat 1 = 6-8, Threat 2 = 9-11, Threat 3 = 12-14, Threat 4 = 15-18+
- **Starting Flow:** Threat 1 = 0-1, Threat 2 = 2-3, Threat 3 = 4-6, Threat 4 = 8-12

### 3. Assign Attributes
- **Primary:** The monster's key strength (+2 to +4)
- **Secondary:** Supporting attributes (+0 to +2)
- **Weak:** Dump stats (-1 to 0)

### 4. Create Attacks
- **Damage:** 2d6 + relevant attribute
- **Range:** Based on concept
- **Special Properties:** Keep it simple (1-2 max)

### 5. Add 1-3 Abilities
- **Cost Flow** appropriately
- **Match threat level** (minions get simple abilities, legendary adversaries get complex ones)
- **Support tactics** and role

### 6. Write Tactics Section
- How does it fight?
- When does it use abilities?
- What are its goals?

---

## Monster Types

Monsters come in various categories that inform their abilities and behavior:

### Beasts
Natural animals, often enhanced or dire versions
- Use Body and Awareness primarily
- Instinctive tactics
- Pack mentality or solo hunters

### Humanoids
Intelligent bipeds with society and culture
- Use tools and tactics
- Can have any class abilities
- Negotiate or can be reasoned with

### Undead
Animated dead or deathless spirits
- Often mindless or single-minded
- Immune to many conditions
- May have life-draining abilities

### Constructs
Animated objects or magical creations
- Immune to mind-affecting
- Follow programming/orders
- Unusual vulnerabilities

### Dragons & Monsters
Legendary creatures of power
- Multiple special abilities

- Iconic, memorable encounters

### Aberrations
Unnatural, alien beings
- Weird abilities
- Break normal rules
- Psychologically disturbing

---

## Flow Dynamics in Combat

Understanding how monsters interact with the Flow economy:

### Flow Generation
- **Players generate Flow** by defeating monsters (+1 per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- **Players generate Flow** through successful attacks in Aggressive Stance
- **Monsters generate Flow** the same way (if intelligent/tactical)

### Flow Usage
- **Minions** rarely use abilities (no Flow)
- **Standard enemies** use 1-Flow abilities tactically
- **Champions** can afford multiple abilities
- **Legendary adversaries** manage Flow like PCs

### Encounter Pacing
- **Start:** Players often at moderate Flow, monsters at starting value
- **Middle:** Flow exchanges as attacks succeed, abilities fire
- **End:** Players have accumulated Flow from defeats, finish strong

This creates natural dramatic pacing where players build momentum through the encounter.

# Part I: Threat Levels & Encounter Design


Before diving into the bestiary, understand how to use threat levels to create balanced, engaging encounters.

# MONSTERS & NPCS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Monsters Effectively

This guide helps you leverage the monster system to create engaging, dynamic encounters that feel natural within the Flow economy.

## Encounter Building Basics

### Party Size & Threat Assessment

**Standard Party:** 4 players

**Encounter Budget by Difficulty:**

**Easy Encounter:**
- 4-6 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 2-3 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1

**Moderate Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 2-4 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 3-4 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 2 Threat 2 + 3-4 Threat 1

**Hard Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1, OR
- 2 Threat 3 champions, OR
- 5-6 Threat 2 standard enemies

**Deadly Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary (solo), OR
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary + supporting minions, OR
- 3 Threat 3 champions

### Scaling for Party Size

**3-Player Party:**
- Reduce enemy count by 1-2
- Or reduce one enemy's threat level
- Consider giving players +1 starting Flow

**5-6 Player Party:**
- Add 1-2 more enemies
- Or increase one enemy's threat level
- Or add environmental challenges

## Flow Management for Encounters

### Starting Flow

**Monsters:**
- Minions (Threat 1): 0-1 Flow
- Standard (Threat 2): 2-3 Flow
- Champion (Threat 3): 4-6 Flow
- Legendary (Threat 4): 8-12 Flow

**Players:**
- Ambush/surprise: Start at 0-2 Flow
- Standard start: 3-5 Flow (from previous encounter or scene)
- Prepared/advantageous: 5-7 Flow

### Flow During Combat

**Players Generate Flow By:**
- Successful attacks in Aggressive Stance (+1 Flow)
- Building in Defensive Stance (+1 Flow per turn)
- Defeating monsters (+1 Flow per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- Using certain calling benefits

**Monsters Generate Flow By:**
- Same rules as players (if intelligent enough)
- Minions typically don't manage Flow tactically
- Standard+ enemies can use Flow economy

**Result:** Players typically accumulate Flow advantage as combat progresses, creating dramatic momentum toward victory.

## Monster Tactics by Intelligence

### Mindless (Intelligence 0)

**Examples:** Zombies, oozes, animated objects

**Tactics:**
- Attack nearest target
- No tactical Flow usage
- No retreat
- Predictable patterns

**Running Them:**
- Simple to play
- Fast resolution
- Let players feel smart
- Focus on positioning/numbers

### Animal (Intelligence 1)

**Examples:** Wolves, bears, giant spiders

**Tactics:**
- Pack coordination
- Focus on weak targets
- Retreat when badly hurt
- Simple ambush tactics

**Running Them:**
- Use pack tactics (flank, surround)
- Target casters/wounded
- Flee at 1/4 Vitality
- Environmental advantages

### Low Intelligence (Intelligence 2)

**Examples:** Goblins, ogres, orcs

**Tactics:**
- Basic strategy (focus fire, use cover)
- Simple Flow usage (1 ability, then basic attacks)
- Retreat when losing badly
- Follow leader

**Running Them:**
- Use terrain advantages
- Focus fire on one target
- Use 1-Flow abilities when available
- Morale breaks matter

### Average Intelligence (Intelligence 3)

**Examples:** Bandits, cultists, soldiers

**Tactics:**
- Coordinated strategy
- Tactical Flow usage
- Adapt to player tactics
- Use equipment and abilities

**Running Them:**

- Use abilities at key moments
- Coordinate attacks
- Retreat strategically

### High Intelligence (Intelligence 4+)

**Examples:** Wizards, dragons, master strategists

**Tactics:**
- Complex plans
- Optimal Flow management
- Anticipate player actions
- Environmental control

**Running Them:**
- Multi-turn strategies
- Save resources for key moments
- Exploit weaknesses
- Have backup plans

## Tactical Positioning

### Zones in Combat

Recall the zone system:
- **Close:** Melee range (same zone)
- **Near:** Short range (adjacent zone)
- **Far:** Long range (2+ zones away)

### Monster Positioning Tactics

**Minion Swarms:**
- Surround single targets
- Block escape routes
- Force area effect targets

**Ranged Attackers:**
- Stay at Far range
- Use cover
- Focus fire with allies

**Spellcasters:**
- Stay at Near/Far range
- Behind frontline
- Positioned for area effects

**Champions/Legendary:**
- Control center of battlefield
- Force players to come to them
- Use lair advantages

## Monster Abilities & Flow

### When to Use Abilities

**1-Flow Abilities:**
- Use early and often
- Save one for emergency
- Standard enemies can afford 2-3 per fight

**3-Flow Abilities:**
- Save for critical moments
- Champion enemies can afford 1-2 per fight
- Use when it will turn the tide

**5-Flow Abilities:**
- Legendary adversaries only usually
- Save for dramatic moments
- Use when players think they're winning

### Telegraphing Big Attacks

When a monster is about to use a powerful ability:
1. **Describe the wind-up** ("The dragon's throat glows with building flame...")
2. **Give players a chance to react** (ready defense, move, interrupt)
3. **Execute dramatically** (describe the awesome effect)

This creates tension without feeling cheap.

## Monster Death & Flow

### Defeat Generates Flow

When a monster is defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** Players gain +1 Flow (distributed to attacking player or party)
- **Threat 4:** Players gain +2 Flow

### Morale & Retreat

Intelligent monsters should retreat when:
- Leader/champion defeated
- Reduced to 25% of original force
- Clearly losing

Don't fight every battle to total annihilation—retreating enemies:
- Create recurring villains
- Feel more realistic
- Can return with reinforcements
- Provide information to players

## Special Situations

### Monster Spellcasting

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:
- Choose appropriate attribute (Mind for wizards, Will for clerics, etc.)
- Pay Flow costs
- Use same spell rules as PCs

**GM Shortcut:** Pre-select which attribute each monster caster uses to speed play.

### Monsters vs. Callings

Player callings interact with monsters:
- **Explorer:** Might trigger on first encounter with creature type
- **Scholar:** Can use knowledge to identify weaknesses
- **Protector:** Gets benefits when allies threatened
- **Avenger:** Might have specific enemy types
- **Ascendant:** Legendary adversaries provide great moments

Design encounters that let callings shine.

### Monsters vs. Stances

**Against Aggressive Players:**
- Focus fire to force Defensive switches
- Use crowd control
- Spread damage around

**Against Defensive Players:**
- Force them to act (threaten NPCs, time pressure)
- Area effects hit defensive targets
- Wear down resources

**Against Balanced Players:**
- Adapt to their tactics
- Create situations forcing stance switches
- Reward tactical play

## Environmental Factors

### Lair Advantages

Legendary adversaries in their lairs might have:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, falling rocks)
- **Minion reinforcements** (arrive each round)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, cover)
- **Magical effects** (darkness, silence zones)

### Using Terrain

**Elevation:**
- High ground grants advantage
- Low ground restricts visibility
- Falling damage is real

**Cover:**
- Grants defense bonus
- Blocks line of sight
- Can be destroyed

**Obstacles:**
- Require movement to navigate
- Create tactical positioning
- Force ranged vs. melee decisions

**Hazards:**
- Damage per turn
- Require saves/checks
- Change battlefield

## Encounter Pacing

### Opening (Rounds 1-2)

**Goals:**
- Establish positioning
- Set up combos
- Assess threats

**Monster Tactics:**
- Aggressive opening
- Use terrain
- Spread damage

### Middle (Rounds 3-4)

**Goals:**
- Execute strategies
- Adapt to threats
- Manage resources

**Monster Tactics:**
- Focus fire
- Use key abilities
- Coordinate attacks

### Climax (Rounds 5+)

**Goals:**
- Finish the fight
- Spend remaining resources
- Heroic moments

**Monster Tactics:**
- Desperate measures
- Big abilities
- All-in attacks

**Note:** Most fights should resolve in 4-6 rounds. Longer = potential slog.

## Running Multiple Monsters

### Group Initiative

To speed play:
- **Group by type:** All goblins act together
- **Clear turn order:** Players → Minions → Champions → Legendary
- **Fast resolution:** Roll all attacks at once

### Tracking HP & Flow

**Techniques:**
- Index cards for each monster/group
- Dry-erase battle mat with stats
- Note pad with quick tallies
- Digital tools if preferred

**What to Track:**
- Current Vitality
- Current Flow
- Status effects
- Used abilities

### Speeding Combat

**Do:**
- Pre-roll damage
- Group similar monsters
- Have stat blocks ready
- Describe attacks quickly

**Don't:**
- Recalculate basics every turn
- Narrate every mundane attack
- Let monster turns drag
- Over-complicate

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Too Many Monsters

**Problem:** Combat becomes tedious
**Solution:** Use fewer, more interesting monsters. 6-8 enemies max usually.

### Mistake: Ignoring Flow Economy

**Problem:** Monsters don't feel integrated
**Solution:** Track monster Flow, use abilities tactically

### Mistake: Monsters Fight to Death

**Problem:** Unrealistic, prevents recurring villains
**Solution:** Smart enemies retreat at 25% strength

### Mistake: No Tactical Variety

**Problem:** Every fight feels same
**Solution:** Mix threat levels, use terrain, vary tactics

### Mistake: Overwhelming Opening

**Problem:** Players feel helpless early
**Solution:** Build difficulty, use minions early, save champions for middle

## Improvising Monsters

Need a monster on the fly?

### 30-Second Monster

1. **Threat Level:** Based on party level and desired difficulty
2. **Vitality:** Use threat level guidelines
3. **Guard:** 7 + threat level + 1d4
4. **Attack:** 2d6 + threat level
5. **One Simple Ability:** Costs 1 Flow, does something interesting

**Example:** Sudden ambush by bandits? Threat 2, Vitality 10, Guard 10, Attack 2d6+2, Ability: "Smoke Bomb" (1 Flow - create obscurement, escape).

### Scaling Existing Monsters

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce Vitality by 25%
- Reduce starting Flow by 2
- Remove one ability

**Make Harder:**
- Increase Vitality by 50%
- Increase starting Flow by 2-3
- Add one ability
- Increase attributes by +1

## Creating Memorable Fights

### Elements of Great Encounters

1. **Clear Stakes:** What happens if players lose?
2. **Interesting Terrain:** More than empty room
3. **Tactical Choices:** Multiple valid approaches
4. **Dramatic Pacing:** Build to climax
5. **Character Moments:** Let PCs shine

### Set-Piece Battles

**Legendary Adversary Phases:**
- Phase 1: Initial tactics (full strength)
- Phase 2: Escalation at 50% (desperation, new abilities)
- Phase 3: Final stand at 25% (all-out, environmental collapse)

**Waves:**
- Wave 1: Initial enemies
- Wave 2: Reinforcements arrive (round 3)
- Wave 3: Champion/legendary shows up (round 5)

**Environmental Changes:**
- Building collapses
- Fire spreads
- Water rises
- Darkness falls

## Encounter as Story

Every combat tells a story:
- **Setup:** Who, where, why
- **Complication:** Unexpected element
- **Climax:** Critical moment
- **Resolution:** Consequences

Don't just run fights—narrate battles that players remember.

---

## Quick Reference: Running Combat

**Each Round:**
1. Declare actions (players describe intent)
2. Roll initiative if needed (or use set order)
3. Resolve actions (attacks, abilities, movement)
4. Update Flow (generate/spend, track)
5. Check morale/conditions
6. Narrate results dramatically

**GM Reminders:**
- Track monster Flow
- Use abilities tactically
- Retreat when appropriate
- Describe awesome moments
- Keep pacing brisk

---

*Running monsters well makes combat engaging. Use the Flow economy, think tactically, and create memorable battles that serve the story.*



# MONSTERS & NPCS - SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## How Monsters Integrate with PC Systems

Monsters aren't a separate system—they participate fully in the Flow economy and interact naturally with all PC abilities. This document explains those interactions in detail.

## Monsters and the Flow Economy

### Flow Generation

Monsters generate Flow the same way PCs do:

**In Aggressive Stance:**
- Successful attack = +1 Flow

**In Defensive Stance:**
- Each turn spent building = +1 Flow
- Can use defensive abilities

**From Defeats:**
- When monster defeats enemy = +1 Flow (if intelligent enough to capitalize)
- Usually only matters for smart/elite monsters

### Flow Expenditure

Monsters spend Flow on:
- Special abilities (cost varies)
- Spells (if spellcaster)
- Enhanced attacks
- Defensive reactions

### Starting Flow by Threat Level

- **Threat 1 (Minions):** 0-1 Flow
- **Threat 2 (Standard):** 2-3 Flow
- **Threat 3 (Elite):** 4-6 Flow
- **Threat 4 (legendary adversary):** 8-12 Flow

### Flow from Defeating Monsters

Players gain Flow when monsters are defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** +1 Flow to party
- **Threat 4:** +2 Flow to party

**Distribution Options:**
- **To attacker:** Player who landed killing blow gets Flow
- **To party:** Distribute evenly or strategically
- **GM discretion:** Whatever keeps game moving

## Monsters and Combat Stances

### Intelligent Monsters Use Stances

**Aggressive Stance:**
- Berserkers, aggressive beasts
- Generate Flow through attacks
- Trade defense for offense

**Defensive Stance:**
- Tanks, defensive fighters
- Build Flow, improve Guard
- Protect allies or objectives

**Balanced Stance:**
- Most standard enemies
- Versatile, no penalties
- Adapt to situation

**Note:** Mindless monsters don't consciously choose stances—just use Balanced as default.

### Monsters vs. Player Stances

**When Players in Aggressive:**
- Monsters take more damage
- Players generate more Flow
- Consider defensive monsters or spread attacks

**When Players in Defensive:**
- Harder to hit players
- Players building Flow
- Use area effects or force action

**When Players in Balanced:**
- Standard interactions
- Adapt to their tactics
- Mix your approaches

## Monsters and Magic

### Monster Spellcasters

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:

**Choose Casting Attribute:**
- **Wizard-type:** Mind (precision, control)
- **Sorcerer-type:** Awareness (power, instinct)
- **Cleric-type:** Will (reliability, faith)
- **Bard-type:** Presence (social, fear)

**Follow Same Rules:**
- Pay Flow costs
- Roll 2d6 + Attribute + Sorcery
- Same success thresholds
- Same spell effects

**GM Shortcuts:**
- Pre-select attribute for each caster
- Note which spells they know
- Track Flow separately

### Example Monster Spellcasters

**Goblin Shaman (Threat 2)**
- Casts with Awareness (instinctive)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Heal
- Starts with 3 Flow
- Uses Bolt until low, then heals self

**Enemy Wizard (Threat 3)**
- Casts with Mind (calculated)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Shield, Fireball
- Starts with 5 Flow
- Opens with Shield, uses Bolt, saves Fireball for groups

**Demon Lord (Threat 4)**
- Casts with Will (overwhelming power)
- Knows: Most spells including Master tier
- Starts with 10 Flow
- Can cast at negative Flow (Will attribute)

### Counterspelling Monsters

Players can Dispel monster spells:
- Ready action to counter
- Roll Dispel vs. monster's casting roll
- Costs player's Flow
- Dramatic moment

## Monsters and Callings

Player callings interact with monsters naturally:

### Explorer

## Encounter Balancing with Systems

### Action Economy

**The Most Important Factor:**

**4 Players vs. 4 Monsters:** Balanced action economy
**4 Players vs. 8 Minions:** Monsters have advantage
**4 Players vs. 2 Elites:** Players have advantage

**Solution:** Mix threat levels
- 1 Champion + 4 Minions = balanced for 4 players
- Champion provides threat, minions provide action parity

### Flow Economy

**Monitor Flow Totals:**

**Players Start:** 3-5 Flow each = 12-20 total
**Monsters Start:** Varies by threat level

**During Fight:**
- Players accumulate from defeats
- Smart monsters use abilities to pressure
- By end, players usually have Flow advantage

**Result:** Natural momentum toward player victory

### Resource Attrition

**Multiple Encounters:**
- Deplete player resources (Flow, Vitality, abilities)
- Minion fights between major encounters
- Rest/recovery between adventure segments

**Single Big Fight:**
- Players can nova (use everything)
- Make it count—legendary adversary should be memorable
- Allow time to build Flow first

## Creating Challenging Encounters

### What Makes Fights Hard

**NOT Just More HP:**
- Higher Vitality alone = slog
- Boring if monster just "tank"

**Tactical Challenges:**
- Monster abilities force decisions
- Environmental hazards
- Time pressure
- Protect innocent NPCs
- Multiple objectives

**Resource Pressure:**
- Multiple encounters before rest
- Flow depletion
- Vitality damage
- Ability usage

### Encounter Difficulty Knobs

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce monster count
- Lower starting Flow
- Remove one ability
- Better player positioning

**Make Harder:**
- Add 1-2 monsters
- Increase starting Flow
- Add environmental hazard
- Worse player positioning
- Time pressure

### When to Adjust On-the-Fly

**Fight Too Easy:**
- Reinforcements arrive
- Monster gets "second wind"
- Environmental complication

**Fight Too Hard:**
- Monster retreats early
- Reinforcements for players
- Environmental advantage appears

**Never:** Just fudge dice repeatedly—kills tension

## Using Legendary Adversaries

### Multi-Phase Design

Major adversary encounters should have clear phases with changing tactics:

**Phase 1 (100%-50% Vitality):**
- Confident, uses moderate abilities
- Tests party capabilities
- Uses minions and lair actions

**Phase 2 (50%-25% Vitality):**
- More aggressive
- Uses powerful abilities
- Shifts tactics based on threats

**Phase 3 (Below 25% Vitality):**
- Desperate or enraged
- Uses most powerful abilities
- All resources committed

### Lair Advantages

Boss encounters are often more interesting in prepared environments:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, traps, collapsing ceilings)
- **Minion reinforcements** (waves of lesser creatures)
- **Magical effects** (scrying, teleportation circles, buffs)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, difficult terrain for party)

### Solo or Supported?

**Pure Solo Adversary:**
- Higher Vitality
- More abilities
- Lair actions compensate for action economy

**Adversary + Minions:**
- Slightly lower adversary stats
- Minions add complexity
- Adversary uses minions tactically

### Pacing Considerations

Legendary encounters should be epic and memorable:
- **6-10+ rounds** typical duration
- **Flow accumulation** party builds resources through fight
- **Dramatic moments** legendary resistances, phase transitions, near-death saves
- **Tactical variety** each phase feels different

### Escape and Consequences

Many major villains shouldn't die on first defeat:
- **Contingency escapes** (teleport, dimension door, etc.)
- **Phylacteries** (liches, certain undead)
- **Planar nature** (demons, devils reform in home plane)
- **Loyal minions** (sacrifice themselves to save adversary)

This creates recurring villains and ongoing story arcs.

---

## Customizing Legendary Adversaries

### Scaling Up
- **More Vitality** (+5-10 per party member above 4)
- **Higher Flow** (+2-4 for larger parties)
- **Extra abilities** (1 additional ability per 2 party members above 4)
- **Minion support** (add Threat 1-2 minions)

### Scaling Down
- **Less Vitality** (-5-10 for smaller party)
- **Lower Flow** (-2-4 starting Flow)
- **Remove complex abilities** (keep iconic ones only)
- **Reduce lair actions** (every other round instead of every round)

### Thematic Variations

Same chassis, different story:
- **Adult Red Dragon** → Adult Blue Dragon (lightning breath, desert lair)
- **Lich** → Mummy Lord (Egyptian themed, desert curses)
- **Beholder** → Death Tyrant (undead beholder, negative energy)
- **Demon Lord** → Devil Duke (lawful evil, contracts, different abilities)
- **Archmage** → Archdruid (nature spells, Wild Shape, beast summons)

---

*Legendary adversaries are the pinnacle of challenge in Flow RPG. They should be memorable, epic encounters that require full party coordination and resource management. Design them to be climactic moments that define campaigns.*




# Part III: Non-Player Characters


Templates and guidelines for creating memorable NPCs—allies, rivals, merchants, nobles, and more.

# NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS (NPCs)

NPCs are the supporting cast of your campaign—allies, rivals, merchants, nobles, and everyday people who populate the world. Unlike monsters designed primarily for combat, NPCs serve narrative and social functions with combat statistics available when needed.

## Design Philosophy

NPCs should be:
- **Quick to create** - Use simplified stat blocks
- **Narratively rich** - Personality and goals drive behavior
- **Flexible** - Easy to scale up/down for different situations
- **Social first** - Combat stats are secondary to role

---

## NPC Stat Block Format

NPCs use a simplified format compared to combat monsters:

```
NPC NAME
Role: [Brief description]
Motivation: [What drives them]

ATTRIBUTES (if combat occurs)
Primary: [+X]  Secondary: [+X]  Other: [+0 to +1]

DEFENSES (if needed)
Vitality: [X]  Guard: [X]  Flow: [X]

KEY SKILLS
- [What they're good at]
- [Notable abilities]
- [Social influence]

PERSONALITY
[Brief description of how they act]

CONNECTIONS
[Who they know, what they control]
```

---

- **Competent** (Threat 1) - Basic training
- **Skilled** (Threat 2) - Professional level
- **Expert** (Threat 3) - Master of their craft
- **Legendary** (Threat 4) - World-class capability

### Step 3: Assign Key Attributes
Only detail what matters for their role:
- Combat NPC: Body, Awareness
- Social NPC: Presence, Will
- Knowledge NPC: Mind
- Perceptive NPC: Awareness

### Step 4: Add Personality
3-5 descriptive traits that drive behavior

### Step 5: Establish Connections
Who they know, what resources they control

### Converting to Combat
