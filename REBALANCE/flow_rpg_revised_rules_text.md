*These sections directly replace the corresponding sections in the original Core Rulebook*

## BASIC MECHANICS (Revised)

### Core Resolution System

**Basic Roll:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill

Roll two six-sided dice, add your relevant attribute modifier (ranging from -5 to +5) and your skill rating (ranging from -2 to +8). Compare the total to the target number to determine your success.

**Standard Target Number:** 8 (moderate difficulty)

**Difficulty Scale:**
- **Trivial (TN 6):** Routine tasks under pressure
- **Easy (TN 7):** Basic professional work
- **Standard (TN 8):** Challenging professional tasks
- **Hard (TN 10):** Expert-level challenges
- **Extreme (TN 12):** Near-impossible feats
- **Legendary (TN 14):** Mythic achievements

**Success Tiers:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates Flow for opponent or creates consequences)
- **7-9:** Partial Success (succeeds with a cost or complication)
- **10-12:** Full Success (achieves your goal as intended)
- **13+:** Critical Success (generates extra Flow and exceptional results)
- **Beat TN by 5+:** Enhanced Success (gain advantage on next roll)
- **Beat TN by 8+:** Legendary Success (major narrative permission)

### The Flow System

Flow is the central resource that powers combat techniques, spells, and narrative advantages. It represents your character's momentum, focus, and command of the situation.

**Flow Range:** -3 to +6 (reduced from original)

**Starting Flow:** 0 (neutral position)
- **Exception:** Scholars start each scene at +1 Flow

**Flow States:**
- **Positive Flow (+1 to +6):** "In the flow," riding momentum, advantage
- **Zero Flow (0):** Neutral state, balanced position
- **Negative Flow (-1 to -3):** Disrupted, struggling, disadvantage

**Generating Flow:**
- Critical success on any roll: +1 Flow
- Successful attack in Aggressive stance: +1 Flow
- Successful defense in Defensive stance: +1 Flow
- Being attacked while in Defensive stance: +1 Flow (once per round)
- Taking any damage: +1 Flow (new rule - helps all characters maintain momentum)
- Casting a cantrip successfully: +1 Flow
- Archetype abilities (varies)
- Calling-specific triggers (rebalanced for reliability)

**Spending Flow:**
- Enhance dice rolls (+1 per point spent)
- Trigger combat techniques (varies by technique)
- Cast intermediate and advanced spells (-1 to -3)
- Access narrative advantages (GM discretion)
- No cost for stance switching (revised from original)

**Core Philosophy:** Flow is moment-to-moment momentum that ebbs and flows naturally. All character types can generate Flow through their preferred playstyle - aggressive fighters through offense, defensive fighters through protection, and spellcasters through magical success.

### Skill System (Revised)

Skills represent your character's training and expertise in various areas. Each skill has seven possible ratings:

**Seven-Tier Progression:**
1. **Untrained** (-2 modifier): No formal training
2. **Novice** (-1 modifier): Basic understanding
3. **Competent** (+0 modifier): Professional capability
4. **Professional** (+2 modifier): Skilled practitioner
5. **Expert** (+4 modifier): Recognized master
6. **Master** (+6 modifier): Legendary capability
7. **Legendary** (+8 modifier): Mythic mastery

**Advancement Limits by Milestone Type:**
- **Starting Characters:** Maximum Professional (+2)
- **Minor Milestones:** Can advance up to Expert (+4)
- **Moderate Milestones:** Can advance up to Master (+6)
- **Major Milestones:** Can advance to Legendary (+8)

#### Death & Dying (Revised)

**Death Saves:** Roll 2d6 + Will at the start of each turn:
- **6 or less:** Lose 1 Vitality (getting worse)
- **7-8:** Stable for this round
- **9-11:** Stabilize at 0 Vitality (unconscious but stable)
- **12+:** Regain consciousness at 1 Vitality

**Death:** Occurs at -3 Vitality (reduced from -5)
**Stabilization:** Medicine check (TN 8) or any magical healing

#### Magic Access (Revised)
**Universal Rule:** If your archetype provides the Sorcery skill, you can cast spells regardless of your attributes.

**Alternative Access:** Characters without a spellcasting archetype can learn magic if:
- Mind + Awareness ≥ +2 (Arcane magic)
- Will + Presence ≥ +2 (Divine magic)
- Awareness + Will ≥ +2 (Primal magic)
