# THREAT LEVEL 1: MINIONS

Minions are weak enemies designed to be defeated easily, generating Flow for players and creating dynamic battlefield conditions through sheer numbers.

## Design Notes

- Create positioning challenges
- Let players feel powerful

**Flow Impact:**
- Start with 0-1 Flow (rarely use abilities)
- Generate +1 Flow when defeated
- Multiple defeats = significant player Flow gain
