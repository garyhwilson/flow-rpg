# NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS (NPCs)

NPCs are the supporting cast of your campaign—allies, rivals, merchants, nobles, and everyday people who populate the world. Unlike monsters designed primarily for combat, NPCs serve narrative and social functions with combat statistics available when needed.

## Design Philosophy

NPCs should be:
- **Quick to create** - Use simplified stat blocks
- **Narratively rich** - Personality and goals drive behavior
- **Flexible** - Easy to scale up/down for different situations
- **Social first** - Combat stats are secondary to role

---

## NPC Stat Block Format

NPCs use a simplified format compared to combat monsters:

```
NPC NAME
Role: [Brief description]
Motivation: [What drives them]

ATTRIBUTES (if combat occurs)
Primary: [+X]  Secondary: [+X]  Other: [+0 to +1]

DEFENSES (if needed)
Vitality: [X]  Guard: [X]  Flow: [X]

KEY SKILLS
- [What they're good at]
- [Notable abilities]
- [Social influence]

PERSONALITY
[Brief description of how they act]

CONNECTIONS
[Who they know, what they control]
```

---

## Quick NPC Creation

### Step 1: Define Role
What function does this NPC serve?
- Questgiver, ally, rival, merchant, authority figure, sage, etc.

### Step 2: Determine Capability
- **Commoner** - No combat training, flees danger
- **Trained** - Basic competence, can defend themselves
- **Professional** - Skilled at their trade, dangerous if provoked
- **Veteran** - Master of their craft, formidable in their domain
- **Legendary** - World-class capability, renowned throughout the land

### Step 3: Assign Key Attributes
Only detail what matters for their role:
- Combat NPC: Body, Awareness
- Social NPC: Presence, Will
- Knowledge NPC: Mind
- Perceptive NPC: Awareness

### Step 4: Add Personality
3-5 descriptive traits that drive behavior

### Step 5: Establish Connections
Who they know, what resources they control
