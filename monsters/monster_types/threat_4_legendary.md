# THREAT LEVEL 4: LEGENDARY ADVERSARIES

Legendary adversaries are the most formidable threats—ancient dragons, demon princes, liches, and archvillains who define campaigns and create memorable climactic encounters. They have vast resources, multiple powerful abilities, and the tactical intelligence to challenge entire experienced parties.

## Design Notes

**Role:** Campaign villains, legendary creatures, climactic encounters

**Usage:**
- Solo against full party (typically 4-6 players)
- May have supporting minions or environmental advantages
- Multi-phase fights with changing tactics
- Require full party coordination and resource management

**Flow Impact:**
- Start with 8-12 Flow
- Can use advanced and master abilities
- Generate +2 Flow when defeated (double normal)
- Force party to use ALL accumulated resources

**Design Considerations:**
- **Lair Actions:** Consider adding environmental effects every round
- **Legendary Resistances:** Can succeed on failed saves (limited uses)
- **Phase Transitions:** Change tactics at half/quarter Vitality
- **Minion Support:** Often fought alongside lesser creatures
- **Extended Battles:** Designed for 6-10+ round encounters

## Using Legendary Adversaries

### Multi-Phase Design

Major adversary encounters should have clear phases with changing tactics:

**Phase 1 (100%-50% Vitality):**
- Confident, uses moderate abilities
- Tests party capabilities
- Uses minions and lair actions

**Phase 2 (50%-25% Vitality):**
- More aggressive
- Uses powerful abilities
- Shifts tactics based on threats

**Phase 3 (Below 25% Vitality):**
- Desperate or enraged
- Uses most powerful abilities
- All resources committed

### Lair Advantages

Boss encounters are often more interesting in prepared environments:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, traps, collapsing ceilings)
- **Minion reinforcements** (waves of lesser creatures)
- **Magical effects** (scrying, teleportation circles, buffs)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, difficult terrain for party)

### Solo or Supported?

**Pure Solo Adversary:**
- Higher Vitality
- More abilities
- Lair actions compensate for action economy

**Adversary + Minions:**
- Slightly lower adversary stats
- Minions add complexity
- Adversary uses minions tactically

### Pacing Considerations

Legendary encounters should be epic and memorable:
- **6-10+ rounds** typical duration
- **Flow accumulation** party builds resources through fight
- **Dramatic moments** legendary resistances, phase transitions, near-death saves
- **Tactical variety** each phase feels different

### Escape and Consequences

Many major villains shouldn't die on first defeat:
- **Contingency escapes** (teleport, dimension door, etc.)
- **Phylacteries** (liches, certain undead)
- **Planar nature** (demons, devils reform in home plane)
- **Loyal minions** (sacrifice themselves to save adversary)

This creates recurring villains and ongoing story arcs.

---

## Customizing Legendary Adversaries

### Scaling Up
- **More Vitality** (+5-10 per party member above 4)
- **Higher Flow** (+2-4 for larger parties)
- **Extra abilities** (1 additional ability per 2 party members above 4)
- **Minion support** (add Threat 1-2 minions)

### Scaling Down
- **Less Vitality** (-5-10 for smaller party)
- **Lower Flow** (-2-4 starting Flow)
- **Remove complex abilities** (keep iconic ones only)
- **Reduce lair actions** (every other round instead of every round)

### Thematic Variations

Same chassis, different story:
- **Adult Red Dragon** → Adult Blue Dragon (lightning breath, desert lair)
- **Lich** → Mummy Lord (Egyptian themed, desert curses)
- **Beholder** → Death Tyrant (undead beholder, negative energy)
- **Demon Lord** → Devil Duke (lawful evil, contracts, different abilities)
- **Archmage** → Archdruid (nature spells, Wild Shape, beast summons)

*Legendary adversaries are the pinnacle of challenge in Flow RPG. They should be memorable, epic encounters that require full party coordination and resource management. Design them to be climactic moments that define campaigns.*
