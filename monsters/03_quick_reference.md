**Ability:** "Protective Stance" - When the merchant is attacked, can intercept (1 Momentum)

**Personality:** Professional, loyal to whoever's paying, will surrender if merchant flees

## ENCOUNTER BUILDING GUIDELINES

### Action Distribution

**The Golden Rule:** Each side should have roughly equal total actions per round.

| Party Size | Recommended Enemy Actions |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 3 PCs      | 3-4 enemy actions total   |
| 4 PCs      | 4-5 enemy actions total   |
| 5 PCs      | 5-6 enemy actions total   |

**WARNING:** A party of 4 vs 8 enemies (8 actions) will be overwhelmed regardless of individual enemy weakness!

### Balancing Many Weak Enemies

When using multiple enemies:

- **4+ enemies:** Reduce their damage by -1 each, OR give them half normal Vitality
- **6+ enemies:** Consider having some flee after allies fall
- **Use minions:** 1 Vitality enemies that die in one hit but still threaten with numbers

### Difficulty Tiers

| Difficulty  | Enemy Actions | Enemy Power Level | Expected Outcome       |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Easy        | Party -1      | Inexperienced     | Win with minor losses  |
| Standard    | Party +0      | Trained           | Win with resource cost |
| Challenging | Party +1      | Veteran           | Win with major effort  |
| Deadly      | Party +2      | Legendary         | Possible defeat        |

### Party Rank vs Enemy Capability

| Party Rank | Appropriate Major Adversary | Appropriate Group      |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Novice     | Trained (1)           | 3-4 Inexperienced      |
| Seasoned   | Veteran (1)           | 4-5 Trained            |
| Veteran    | Legendary (1)         | 2 Veterans + 3 Trained |
| Heroic     | Legendary + minions   | 3-4 Veterans           |

### Making Major Adversary Fights Work

Solo major adversaries need help to avoid being overwhelmed:

- **Multi-action:** Major adversaries act 2-3 times per round (max 2 attacks)
- **Minions:** Add 2-4 weak allies to split party attention
- **Lair actions:** Environment acts once per round
- **Phases:** Adversary transforms or gains new abilities at 50% Vitality

### Quick Encounter Math

**Average PC damage per round:** 7-10 (weapon + attribute)
**Average PC Guard:** 15-17 (base 12 + attribute + gear)

To calculate fight length:
- Total enemy Vitality ÷ (Party DPR × 0.7 hit rate) = rounds to kill enemies
- Total PC Guard ÷ Enemy DPR = rounds until PCs take Vitality damage

**Target:** 3-5 rounds for standard fights

---

## WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

### Fight Too Easy

- Reinforcements arrive
- Environmental complication
- Adversary reveals hidden ability

### Fight Too Hard

- Adversaries make tactical errors
- Morale breaks, some flee
- Environmental opportunity for players

### Combat Dragging

- Adversaries make decisive moves
- Narrate conclusion if outcome obvious
- "With their leader down, the rest surrender"

## TREASURE GUIDELINES

| Adversary Significance | Treasure                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Minor                  | 5-25 gold, mundane equipment      |
| Trained                | 50-150 gold, quality gear         |
| Veteran                | 200-500 gold, magic item possible |
| Legendary              | 1000+ gold, multiple magic items  |

Adjust for narrative appropriateness - a starving wolf has no treasure, a merchant's bodyguard might carry the payroll.
