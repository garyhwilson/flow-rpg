# ADVERSARIES & THE FLOW SYSTEM

Adversaries in Flow RPG use the same core mechanics as player characters. This chapter explains how adversaries interact with Flow, stances, magic, and other game systems.

## Flow Economy

### Adversaries Generate Flow

Intelligent adversaries generate Flow the same way players do:

**Aggressive Stance:** +1 Flow on successful attacks
**Defensive Stance:** +1 Flow per round while holding position
**Defeating opponents:** +1 Flow (though this rarely matters for adversaries)

Not every adversary manages Flow tactically:
- **Animals and mindless undead** don't consciously use Flow
- **Minor opponents** typically start with some Flow but don't track it carefully
- **Significant adversaries** should manage Flow like a player would

### Adversaries Spend Flow

Adversaries spend Flow on:
- Special abilities (listed in their stat block)
- Enhanced attacks
- Spells (for spellcasters)
- Defensive reactions

**Tactical spending** reflects intelligence and personality:
- A desperate bandit burns all Flow on a last-ditch attack
- A calculating mage conserves Flow for the perfect moment
- A protective wolf pack leader spends Flow to defend wounded pack mates

### Starting Flow

How much Flow an adversary begins with depends on their nature:

**Minor opponents:** 0-2 Flow
- A hungry wolf starts at 0
- Town guards start at 1-2

**Skilled adversaries:** 2-4 Flow
- A veteran mercenary starts at 3
- A trained battle mage starts at 4

**Major threats:** 4-6 Flow
- A dragon starts at 5-6
- An archmage villain starts at 6

### Flow When Adversaries Fall

When players defeat an adversary, they gain +1 Flow. This creates natural momentum where players grow stronger as combat progresses.

**Distribution options:**
- Give it to the player who struck the final blow
- Distribute among players who contributed
- Add to a shared "party Flow" pool

For particularly significant victories - a major villain, a campaign-changing battle - consider awarding +2 Flow.

## Stances in Combat

Intelligent adversaries can use the stance system:

### Aggressive Stance

**When adversaries use it:**
- Berserkers and rage-driven creatures
- When trying to overwhelm opponents quickly
- When confident of victory

**Effects:**
- Generate +1 Flow on successful attacks
- Take increased risk

### Defensive Stance

**When adversaries use it:**
- Protecting something or someone
- Buying time for reinforcements
- When outnumbered but cornered

**Effects:**
- +2 to Guard
- Generate +1 Flow per round

### Balanced Stance

**Most adversaries use this** - it's the default when no tactical reason demands otherwise.

**Note:** Mindless creatures and animals don't consciously choose stances. Treat them as always Balanced.

## Magic and Spellcasting

Adversary spellcasters use the same magic system as players.

### Casting Attributes

Different adversaries cast with different attributes:

**Mind (calculated, precise):**
- Trained wizards
- Scholarly mages
- Tactical spellcasters

**Awareness (instinctive, powerful):**
- Sorcerers
- Shamans
- Naturally magical creatures

**Will (faith, determination):**
- Clerics and priests
- Paladins
- Devout spellcasters

**Presence (force of personality):**
- Bards
- Demon lords
- Charismatic spellcasters

### Running Spellcaster Adversaries

**Preparation:** Before the fight, know:
- Which attribute they use
- 2-4 spells they're likely to cast
- How much Flow they're willing to spend on magic

**In combat:**
- Cast the same way players do: 2d6 + Attribute + Sorcery skill
- Pay Flow costs
- Apply the same rules for success and failure

### Example: Magister Celia Thornwood

A battle mage adversary (see bestiary):
- Casts with Mind (+3)
- Sorcery skill (+2)
- Starting Flow: 4
- Knows: Fire Bolt, Shield, Lightning Arc

**Round 1:** Celia casts Shield (+2 Guard for scene, costs 1 Flow). Flow: 3.
**Round 2:** Casts Lightning Arc at two targets (costs 1 Flow). Flow: 2.
**Round 3:** Uses Fire Bolt (costs 0 Flow, cantrip).
**Round 4:** If threatened, spends remaining Flow on defensive abilities.

## Adversaries and Player Abilities

### Responding to Player Callings

Player callings create opportunities for interesting adversary interactions:

**Guardian players:** Include threats to NPCs the party cares about

**Scholar players:** Give adversaries interesting lore and weaknesses to discover

**Exemplar players:** Create adversaries worthy of dramatic confrontation

**Seeker players:** Include mysteries about why adversaries are here

Design adversaries that let players use their callings. A Guardian shines when there's someone to protect. A Scholar shines when knowledge matters.

### Player Archetype Interactions

**Fighters:** Adversaries should present tactical challenges, not just damage sponges

**Wizards:** Some adversaries should be vulnerable to magic, others resistant

**Rogues:** Include environments that reward stealth and positioning

**Clerics:** Undead adversaries, moral complexity, people who need healing

**Rangers:** Wilderness adversaries, tracking opportunities, territorial creatures

**Paladins:** Evil to smite, innocents to protect, moral dilemmas

**Bards:** Social adversaries, creatures that can be charmed or demoralized

---

## Special Creature Rules

### Swarms

When fighting masses of tiny creatures (rats, bats, insects), treat the entire swarm as a single entity:

**Statistics:**
- Guard 8-12 (hard to hit effectively)
- Vitality 15-25 (represents critical mass)
- Damage 2d6 (engulfs targets)

**Properties:**
- Takes double damage from area effects
- Takes half damage from single-target attacks
- Can occupy the same space as characters
- Disperses at 0 Vitality rather than dying

### Flying Creatures

Creatures that fly:
- Can stay out of melee range
- Control vertical positioning
- Have escape routes ground-bound creatures lack

**Counters:** Ranged attacks, spells, environmental limits (low ceilings, tight spaces)

### Incorporeal Creatures

Ghosts and spirits:
- May resist or ignore physical attacks
- Can move through solid objects
- Often vulnerable to magic or specific materials

### Creatures with Multiple Forms

Some adversaries change during combat:
- A werewolf shifts between human and beast
- A vampire becomes mist when threatened
- A shapeshifter adapts to threats

Track which form they're in and what abilities each form provides.

## Adjusting Difficulty

### Making Fights Easier

If a fight is too hard:
- Adversaries retreat or make tactical errors
- Reinforcements for players arrive
- Environmental changes favor the party
- An adversary's wounds prove more severe than expected

### Making Fights Harder

If a fight is too easy:
- Adversary reinforcements arrive
- Environmental complications emerge
- The adversary reveals hidden abilities
- The situation escalates (fire spreads, hostages are threatened)

### Avoiding Common Problems

**Don't fudge dice constantly** - it undermines tension

**Don't resurrect defeated adversaries** - it feels cheap

**Do adjust circumstances** - the world is dynamic

**Do end fights that are decided** - don't drag out foregone conclusions

---

## Tracking During Combat

### What to Track

**Essential:**
- Current Vitality for each significant adversary
- Current Flow for intelligent adversaries
- Which adversaries have acted this round

**Useful:**
- Damage dealt by each player (for drama and narrative)
- Abilities used (so you don't repeat or forget)
- Conditions affecting adversaries

### Quick Methods

**Index cards:** One per significant adversary or group

**Battlefield notes:** Jot stats on a dry-erase map

**Mental tracking:** For simple fights, just remember rough status

### Groups of Similar Adversaries

When running multiple similar opponents (a patrol of guards, a pack of wolves):

- Track total damage to the group
- Describe individuals falling as damage accumulates
- "The guards have taken 45 damage - two are down, one is badly wounded, one seems fresh"

---

## Quick Reference

### Adversary Flow

How much Flow an adversary starts with depends on who they are and what the scene demands:

**Inexperienced or surprised adversaries** typically begin with 0-2 Flow. A nervous bandit ambushed in their camp, a wild animal startled from sleep, or rank-and-file soldiers caught off guard won't have momentum on their side.

**Prepared or competent adversaries** often start with 2-4 Flow. A veteran mercenary expecting trouble, a court mage who noticed the party's approach, or a pack of wolves stalking prey have had time to assess the situation.

**Formidable adversaries in their element** might begin with 4-6 Flow. A dragon in its lair, a crime lord surrounded by loyal guards, or an ancient vampire on home ground commands the scene from the first moment.

Adjust freely based on narrative circumstances. The same bandit captain might start at 2 Flow when surprised or 5 Flow when executing her own ambush.

### Common Ability Costs

| Cost | Ability Type | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 0 | Natural abilities | Poison bite, natural armor |
| 1 | Basic tactical | Extra movement, minor buff |
| 2 | Significant | Area attack, strong buff |
| 3 | Powerful | Stun, major damage spike |
| 4+ | Dramatic | Fight-changing effects |

### Stance Summary

| Stance | Flow Effect | When Adversaries Use It |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Aggressive | +1 on hit | Overwhelming, confident |
| Defensive | +1/round, +2 Guard | Protecting, outnumbered |
| Balanced | None | Default, adaptable |

*Adversaries and players use the same rules. The difference is in motivation, personality, and goals - not in how the dice work.*
