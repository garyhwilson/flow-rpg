# MONSTERS & NPCS - SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## How Monsters Integrate with PC Systems

Monsters aren't a separate system—they participate fully in the Flow economy and interact naturally with all PC abilities. This document explains those interactions in detail.

## Monsters and the Flow Economy

### Flow Generation

Monsters generate Flow the same way PCs do:

**In Aggressive Stance:**
- Successful attack = +1 Flow

**In Defensive Stance:**
- Each turn spent building = +1 Flow
- Can use defensive abilities

**From Defeats:**
- When monster defeats enemy = +1 Flow (if intelligent enough to capitalize)
- Usually only matters for smart/elite monsters

### Flow Expenditure

Monsters spend Flow on:
- Special abilities (cost varies)
- Spells (if spellcaster)
- Enhanced attacks
- Defensive reactions

### Starting Flow by Threat Level

- **Threat 1 (Minions):** 0-1 Flow
- **Threat 2 (Standard):** 2-3 Flow
- **Threat 3 (Elite):** 4-6 Flow
- **Threat 4 (legendary adversary):** 8-12 Flow

### Flow from Defeating Monsters

Players gain Flow when monsters are defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** +1 Flow to party
- **Threat 4:** +2 Flow to party

**Distribution Options:**
- **To attacker:** Player who landed killing blow gets Flow
- **To party:** Distribute evenly or strategically
- **GM discretion:** Whatever keeps game moving

## Monsters and Combat Stances

### Intelligent Monsters Use Stances

**Aggressive Stance:**
- Berserkers, aggressive beasts
- Generate Flow through attacks
- Trade defense for offense

**Defensive Stance:**
- Tanks, defensive fighters
- Build Flow, improve Guard
- Protect allies or objectives

**Balanced Stance:**
- Most standard enemies
- Versatile, no penalties
- Adapt to situation

**Note:** Mindless monsters don't consciously choose stances—just use Balanced as default.

### Monsters vs. Player Stances

**When Players in Aggressive:**
- Monsters take more damage
- Players generate more Flow
- Consider defensive monsters or spread attacks

**When Players in Defensive:**
- Harder to hit players
- Players building Flow
- Use area effects or force action

**When Players in Balanced:**
- Standard interactions
- Adapt to their tactics
- Mix your approaches

## Monsters and Magic

### Monster Spellcasters

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:

**Choose Casting Attribute:**
- **Wizard-type:** Mind (precision, control)
- **Sorcerer-type:** Awareness (power, instinct)
- **Cleric-type:** Will (reliability, faith)
- **Bard-type:** Presence (social, fear)

**Follow Same Rules:**
- Pay Flow costs
- Roll 2d6 + Attribute + Sorcery
- Same success thresholds
- Same spell effects

**GM Shortcuts:**
- Pre-select attribute for each caster
- Note which spells they know
- Track Flow separately

### Example Monster Spellcasters

**Goblin Shaman (Threat 2)**
- Casts with Awareness (instinctive)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Heal
- Starts with 3 Flow
- Uses Bolt until low, then heals self

**Enemy Wizard (Threat 3)**
- Casts with Mind (calculated)
- Knows: Spark, Bolt, Shield, Fireball
- Starts with 5 Flow
- Opens with Shield, uses Bolt, saves Fireball for groups

**Demon Lord (Threat 4)**
- Casts with Will (overwhelming power)
- Knows: Most spells including Master tier
- Starts with 10 Flow
- Can cast at negative Flow (Will attribute)

### Counterspelling Monsters

- Ready action to counter
- Roll Dispel vs. monster's casting roll
- Costs player's Flow
- Dramatic moment

## Encounter Balancing with Systems

### Action Economy

**4 Players vs. 8 Minions:** Monsters have advantage
**4 Players vs. 2 Elites:** Players have advantage

**Solution:** Mix threat levels
- 1 Champion + 4 Minions = balanced for 4 players
- Champion provides threat, minions provide action parity

### Flow Economy

**Monitor Flow Totals:**

**Players Start:** 3-5 Flow each = 12-20 total
**Monsters Start:** Varies by threat level

**During Fight:**
- Players accumulate from defeats
- Smart monsters use abilities to pressure
- By end, players usually have Flow advantage

**Result:** Natural momentum toward player victory

### Resource Attrition

**Multiple Encounters:**
- Deplete player resources (Flow, Vitality, abilities)
- Minion fights between major encounters
- Rest/recovery between adventure segments

**Single Big Fight:**
- Players can nova (use everything)
- Make it count—legendary adversary should be memorable
- Allow time to build Flow first

## Creating Challenging Encounters

### What Makes Fights Hard

**NOT Just More HP:**
- Higher Vitality alone = slog
- Boring if monster just "tank"

**Tactical Challenges:**
- Monster abilities force decisions
- Environmental hazards
- Time pressure
- Protect innocent NPCs
- Multiple objectives

**Resource Pressure:**
- Multiple encounters before rest
- Flow depletion
- Vitality damage
- Ability usage

### Encounter Difficulty Knobs

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce monster count
- Lower starting Flow
- Remove one ability
- Better player positioning

**Make Harder:**
- Add 1-2 monsters
- Increase starting Flow
- Add environmental hazard
- Worse player positioning
- Time pressure

### When to Adjust On-the-Fly

**Fight Too Easy:**
- Reinforcements arrive
- Monster gets "second wind"
- Environmental complication

**Fight Too Hard:**
- Monster retreats early
- Reinforcements for players
- Environmental advantage appears

**Never:** Just fudge dice repeatedly—kills tension
