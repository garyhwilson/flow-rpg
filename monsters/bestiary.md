# BESTIARY

This chapter presents adversaries and creatures for your Autumn Phoenix RPG adventures. Each entry is a character with a name, motivation, and personality - not an interchangeable stat block. Use these as inspiration for your own creations.

**A Note on Stats:** The statistics provided are guidelines, not formulas. A goblin scout in your campaign might be tougher or weaker than Skrix presented here. Adjust freely to serve your story.

## Animated Armor

### The Crimson Sentinel

_Guardian of the Thornwood Estate's forbidden vault_

**Motivation:** Protect the vault from all intruders - it has no concept of "authorized" visitors and attacks anyone who enters without speaking the command word lost centuries ago.

**Appearance:** A suit of ornate red-lacquered plate armor that stands motionless in an alcove until someone crosses the threshold. Dried bloodstains mar its gauntlets from centuries of unwary visitors.

**Stats:** Guard 20, Vitality 18
**Combat:** Greatsword (+2): 2d6+2 damage
**Special:** Immune to poison, disease, and mental effects. Cannot be reasoned with. Continues fighting until destroyed.
**Tactics:** Blocks the vault door. Pursues intruders who flee but will not leave the vault chamber. Strikes the nearest target without tactical sophistication.

_Animated guardians typically have Guard 16-22 depending on the quality of the original armor and the power of the enchantment. Ancient dwarven-forged suits may be far more resilient._

---

## Bandit

### Mal "Ironknuckle" Dent

_Desperate highway robber with a gambling debt_

**Motivation:** Owes 200 gold to Vex the Moneylender. Every day he doesn't pay, the interest grows and Vex's patience shrinks. Mal robs travelers not out of cruelty but terror.

**Appearance:** A heavyset man with scarred knuckles and nervous eyes. Wears mismatched armor pieces scavenged from previous victims. His hands shake slightly when he draws his blade.

**Stats:** Guard 13, Vitality 12
**Combat:** Short sword (+1): 1d6+1 damage
**Special:** Will surrender if reduced below half Guard. Knows the local roads intimately.
**Tactics:** Prefers ambush from cover. Calls for targets to "stand and deliver" hoping intimidation works. Flees if the fight turns against him.

_Road bandits typically have Guard 12-15. Those desperate enough to risk robbery are rarely professional fighters - they rely on surprise and numbers._

---

## Battle Mage

### Magister Celia Thornwood

_Disgraced war-wizard seeking redemption through darker means_

**Motivation:** Celia's battle magic failed at the Siege of Kethram, and three hundred soldiers died. She believes forbidden magic could have saved them. Now she researches necromancy, telling herself it's to prevent future tragedies.

**Appearance:** A gaunt woman in her forties wearing scorched military robes. A silver medal hangs around her neck - the Kingdom's Valor, awarded posthumously to her unit. Her eyes have the hollow look of someone who hasn't slept well in years.

**Stats:** Guard 18, Vitality 24, Momentum 4
**Combat:** War Staff (+2): 1d6+1 damage, or spells
**Spells:** Fire Bolt (2d6 damage), Shield (+2 Guard for scene), Lightning Arc (2d6 damage to two targets)
**Special:** Can cast two spells per round. Armor does not penalize her spellcasting.
**Tactics:** Opens with Lightning Arc to thin groups. Uses Shield when pressed. Willing to negotiate if outmatched - she's not ready to die before completing her research.

_Military-trained mages typically have Guard 16-20 and access to 3-5 combat spells. Their danger comes from versatility rather than raw power._

---

## Beholder

### Xanathar-Kul, the Eye Tyrant

_Ancient aberration ruling a subterranean empire_

**Motivation:** Xanathar-Kul has schemed in darkness for three thousand years. It believes itself destined to rule the surface world but is deeply paranoid - it trusts no one, not even its most loyal servants. It eliminates perceived threats preemptively.

**Appearance:** A twelve-foot sphere of mottled purple-grey flesh dominated by a single massive eye. Ten eyestalks writhe constantly, each ending in a smaller eye that glows with different-colored malevolence. Its maw is filled with razor teeth.

**Stats:** Guard 48, Vitality 55, Momentum 6
**Combat:** Bite (+4): 2d6+3 damage
**Eye Rays (choose 3 each round):**

- Death Ray: Target must succeed on Will save or take 4d6 damage
- Disintegration: Target must succeed on Might save or take 3d6 damage
- Charm: Target must succeed on Will save or be charmed for the scene
- Sleep: Target must succeed on Will save or fall unconscious
- Telekinesis: Move or restrain one creature within Far range
- Petrification: Target must succeed on Might save or begin turning to stone

**Special:** Anti-Magic Cone - the central eye projects a cone that suppresses all magic within it. Xanathar-Kul can choose which direction to face each round.
**Tactics:** Paranoid and calculating. Uses anti-magic cone against obvious spellcasters. Eliminates the most dangerous-seeming threat first. Has escape plans prepared.

_Beholders are singular entities - no two are alike. Younger specimens have 4-6 eye rays; ancients like Xanathar-Kul have mastered ten._

---

## Cultist

### Brother Vesk of the Sunken Eye

_Desperate convert seeking meaning through darkness_

**Motivation:** Vesk lost his family to plague and found comfort in the cult's promises of power over death. He's terrified of dying meaningless and believes the Sunken Eye will grant him eternal purpose.

**Appearance:** A gaunt young man in tattered robes marked with a weeping eye symbol. Dark circles under his eyes suggest sleepless nights. His hands bear fresh ritual scars.

**Stats:** Guard 11, Vitality 10
**Combat:** Ritual dagger (+0): 1d6 damage
**Special:** Knows one minor cantrip (usually Prestidigitation or Minor Illusion). Fanatically loyal to cult leadership.
**Tactics:** Attacks in groups of 3-6. Will sacrifice himself for cult leaders. Shouts prayers to the Sunken Eye during combat.

_Cult followers typically have Guard 10-13. Most are converts rather than warriors - their danger lies in numbers and willingness to die for their cause._

---

## Demon Lord

### Kaz'gorath, Prince of Despair

_Arch-demon seeking to corrupt mortal souls_

**Motivation:** Kaz'gorath feeds on despair. He doesn't simply kill - he breaks hope first. He corrupts heroes, ruins kingdoms, and savors the moment when mortals realize their struggles were meaningless.

**Appearance:** A towering figure of shadow and fire, vaguely humanoid but wrong in proportions. Where his face should be is a void that pulls at your courage. His voice is the sound of breaking things.

**Stats:** Guard 58, Vitality 70, Momentum 6
**Combat:** Claws (+5): 3d6+4 damage, or Despairing Touch
**Despairing Touch:** Target loses 1d6 Momentum and cannot regain Momentum for the rest of the scene
**Aura of Hopelessness:** All creatures within Close range have -1 to all rolls

**Special:**

- Immune to fire, poison, and non-magical weapons
- Regenerates 5 Vitality per round unless damaged by holy weapons
- Can teleport anywhere he can see once per round
- Can summon 2d6 lesser demons once per scene

**Tactics:** Toys with opponents rather than destroying them quickly. Targets the party's moral center first. Offers corrupting bargains mid-combat.

_Demon lords are campaign-ending threats. Their statistics matter less than their narrative weight - they should only be confronted after extensive preparation._

---

## Dire Wolf

### Shadowfang, Alpha of the Grey Pines Pack

_Territorial pack leader protecting hunting grounds_

**Motivation:** The Grey Pines have been Shadowfang's territory for fifteen years. He attacks those who threaten his pack or hunt his prey - not out of malice, but survival.

**Appearance:** A massive wolf the size of a horse, with silver-grey fur marked by old battle scars. His eyes show cunning intelligence unusual for a beast.

**Stats:** Guard 18, Vitality 20
**Combat:** Bite (+3): 2d6+2 damage
**Special:** Keen senses - cannot be surprised. Pack tactics - gains +1 to hit when allies are adjacent to target.
**Tactics:** Circles prey to flank. Targets isolated or wounded creatures. Will retreat if pack members are killed - survival of the pack matters more than any single fight.

_Dire wolves typically have Guard 15-20. Pack alphas like Shadowfang are on the higher end; younger wolves range lower. They always fight alongside pack members if possible._

---

## Dragon, Black (Young)

### Mireska, Scourge of the Blackfen

_Ambitious young dragon establishing her territory_

**Motivation:** Mireska is young for a dragon - barely a century old - and desperate to prove herself. She hoards obsessively, attacks caravans to build wealth, and dreams of the day she'll rival the great wyrms.

**Appearance:** Thirty feet of midnight-scaled menace. Her horns curve backward like a crown, and her eyes glow with acidic green malevolence. Scars on her flank show she's been challenged before - and survived.

**Stats:** Guard 32, Vitality 40, Momentum 5
**Combat:** Bite (+4): 2d6+4 damage; Claws (+3): 2d6+2 damage
**Acid Breath:** 4d6 acid damage in a cone (recharges after short rest)

**Special:**

- Flight (can move 2 zones vertically)
- Amphibious - equally comfortable in swamp water
- Frightful Presence: First time each creature sees Mireska, Will save or frightened for 1 round

**Tactics:** Attacks from ambush, preferring to strike from murky water. Uses breath weapon on groups, then focuses claws and bite on individuals. Will flee if reduced below 10 Vitality - she's ambitious, not suicidal.

_Young dragons typically have Guard 28-35 depending on age and experience. Their breath weapons vary by type - black dragons breathe acid, red dragons fire, white dragons frost._

---

## Dragon, Red (Adult)

### Ignathrix the Burning

_Ancient wyrm who destroyed the Kingdom of Valdros_

**Motivation:** Ignathrix believes himself superior to all mortal life. He demands tribute from nearby settlements - gold, livestock, and occasionally maidens (whom he actually employs as servants, finding their terror amusing). Those who refuse burn.

**Appearance:** Sixty feet of crimson scales and fury. His hide is scarred from centuries of battle, including a missing eye from a legendary paladin's last stand. He wears the melted crowns of three kings as trophies on his horns.

**Stats:** Guard 52, Vitality 65, Momentum 6
**Combat:** Bite (+5): 3d6+5 damage; Claws (+4): 2d6+4 damage; Tail (+3): 2d6+2 damage and knockdown
**Fire Breath:** 6d6 fire damage in a cone (recharges after short rest)

**Special:**

- Flight and devastating diving attacks
- Fire Immunity - actually healed by fire damage
- Frightful Presence (automatic fear on first sight)
- Legendary Resilience: Once per scene, can ignore one attack entirely
- Lair Actions: In his volcanic lair, Ignathrix can cause tremors, summon gouts of lava, or fill areas with toxic smoke

**Tactics:** Opens with fire breath against grouped enemies. Uses flight to stay out of melee range. Enjoys monologuing about his superiority. Will retreat to heal only if genuinely threatened - his pride makes this difficult.

_Adult dragons like Ignathrix are regional catastrophes. Confronting one requires armies, legendary heroes, or elaborate schemes. Direct combat against a prepared dragon is suicide._

---

## Giant Rat

### Plague-Bearer Swarms

_Disease-carrying vermin of the undercity_

**Motivation:** Hunger, pure and simple. Giant rats swarm toward warmth and food. They're not malicious - they're animals doing what animals do.

**Appearance:** Rats the size of small dogs, with patchy fur and yellowed teeth. They travel in groups of 4-8, chittering constantly.

**Stats (per rat):** Guard 8, Vitality 6
**Combat:** Bite (+0): 1d6 damage
**Special:** Disease Carrier - any creature bitten must make a Might save or contract Filth Fever (causes -1 to all rolls until cured). Swarm tactics - when 4+ rats attack the same target, they get +2 to hit.
**Tactics:** Swarm isolated targets. Flee when half their number are killed.

_Giant rats typically have Guard 6-10. Larger specimens exist in magical dungeons or areas of supernatural corruption._

---

## Goblin Scout

### Skrix the Wary

_Tribal scout driven by fear of his chieftain_

**Motivation:** Skrix's chieftain, Mogra the Terrible, will kill him if he returns without useful information. He's terrified of humans but more terrified of Mogra. He'll fight only if cornered, preferring to flee and report.

**Appearance:** A small, green-skinned humanoid barely three feet tall, with oversized ears that twitch at every sound. Wears scraps of leather armor and carries a crude short bow. His eyes dart constantly, looking for escape routes.

**Stats:** Guard 11, Vitality 8
**Combat:** Short bow (+1): 1d6 damage; Rusty dagger (+0): 1d6-1 damage
**Special:** Darkvision, excellent at hiding in underbrush (+2 to Stealth in wilderness)
**Tactics:** Attacks only from ambush or when cornered. Prefers to observe and report. Will surrender if captured, offering information about the tribe in exchange for his life.

_Goblin scouts typically have Guard 10-12. They're cowards individually but dangerous in groups of 6 or more, where they find courage in numbers._

---

## Goblin Shaman

### Old Nix, Voice of the Tribe

_Cunning spiritual leader wielding crude magic_

**Motivation:** Nix is the oldest goblin anyone can remember - at least thirty winters, ancient by goblin standards. He maintains power through a mix of genuine magical talent and theatrical intimidation. He genuinely believes the spirits speak through him.

**Appearance:** A wizened goblin with milky eyes and bones woven into his scraggly hair. Carries a staff topped with a rat skull. His voice shifts between a wheeze and a booming pronouncement.

**Stats:** Guard 14, Vitality 14, Momentum 3
**Combat:** Staff (+1): 1d6 damage
**Spells:** Hex (target has -1 to rolls for scene), Cure Wounds (heal 1d6+2), Spirit Bolt (1d6+2 damage)
**Special:** Can see in darkness. Goblin warriors within Close range gain +1 to hit (inspiring presence).
**Tactics:** Stays behind goblin warriors, casting Hex on the most dangerous-looking enemy. Uses Cure Wounds on chieftain or self. Flees if warriors fall.

_Goblin shamans typically have Guard 12-16. Their magic is crude but effective. Most tribes have only one shaman; killing them often breaks tribal morale._

---

## Golem, Stone

### The Warden of the Vault

_Tireless guardian of the Dwarven Treasury_

**Motivation:** The Warden has no motivation in any meaningful sense. It was created to guard the vault, and it will guard the vault until the stones crumble. It knows only the command words of long-dead dwarven kings.

**Appearance:** A twelve-foot humanoid figure carved from granite, its features worn smooth by centuries. Dwarven runes glow faintly on its chest - the binding that gives it purpose.

**Stats:** Guard 38, Vitality 45
**Combat:** Slam (+4): 2d6+4 damage
**Special:**

- Immune to poison, disease, and mental effects
- Resistant to non-magical weapons (half damage)
- Slow (moves one zone every other round)
- Cannot be reasoned with, intimidated, or deceived

**Tactics:** Moves directly toward intruders. Attacks the nearest target. Does not pursue beyond its designated area. Simple, relentless, inevitable.

_Stone golems typically have Guard 32-42 depending on construction. Iron golems are tougher; clay golems are weaker but can be created more quickly._

---

## Lich

### Valdris the Undying

_Ancient wizard who sacrificed everything for immortality_

**Motivation:** Valdris was a court wizard who watched everyone he loved grow old and die. He couldn't bear mortality. Now, seven centuries later, he can barely remember what he was trying to preserve. He continues his research into necromancy simply because it's all he knows.

**Appearance:** A skeletal figure in rotted robes that were once magnificent. Gems still glitter on bony fingers. Cold blue flames burn in empty eye sockets. When he speaks, his voice carries the dust of ages.

**Stats:** Guard 42, Vitality 50, Momentum 6
**Combat:** Paralyzing Touch (+3): 2d6 necrotic damage and target must save or be paralyzed for 1 round
**Spells (extensive repertoire including):**

- Power Word Kill (instant death to creature below 15 Vitality)
- Disintegrate (5d6 damage)
- Counterspell (negate one spell)
- Teleport (escape anywhere)
- Animate Dead (raise 4 skeletons or 2 zombies)

**Special:**

- Rejuvenation: If Valdris is destroyed, he reforms at his phylactery in 1d10 days unless the phylactery is also destroyed
- Legendary Resistance: 3/day, can choose to succeed on a failed save
- Undead Nature: Immune to poison, disease, exhaustion, and fear

**Tactics:** Opens with Disintegrate against obvious threats. Uses undead servants to shield himself. Counterspells enemy magic. Will teleport away if phylactery is threatened - his immortality matters more than any single battle.

_Liches are the result of centuries of magical research and dark bargains. Each is unique. Valdris is moderately powerful for his kind - ancient liches may have Guard 50+ and mastery over reality itself._

---

## Ogre

### Grunthor the Hill-Breaker

_Brutal giant raiding for food and entertainment_

**Motivation:** Grunthor is hungry. Always hungry. He's not particularly malicious - he simply sees smaller creatures as food or obstacles. He's learned that shiny things can be traded for more food, so he collects them.

**Appearance:** Ten feet of muscle and fat covered in warty grey-green skin. His face is almost childlike in its simple expressions - joy when eating, rage when thwarted. Wears a "belt" of rope strung with cooking pots.

**Stats:** Guard 24, Vitality 32
**Combat:** Greatclub (+3): 2d6+4 damage
**Special:** Throw Rock (Far range): 2d6+2 damage. Can grab and throw medium creatures.
**Tactics:** Charges the nearest target. Not sophisticated enough for tactics. Will stop fighting to eat if presented with enough food.

_Ogres typically have Guard 20-26. They're dangerous due to raw strength rather than skill. Ogre mages exist but are rare - Guard 22 but with 3-4 spells._

---

## Orc Warrior

### Grakka Blood-Axe

_Raider who fights for glory and her tribe_

**Motivation:** Grakka believes the old ways are best - strength takes what it needs. She raids human settlements because her tribe is starving after a harsh winter. She's not cruel by nature, just practical about survival.

**Appearance:** A muscular orc woman with ritual scars across her shoulders marking her kills. Her armor is a mix of forged steel and scavenged plate. The axe she carries has killed seventeen enemies - she knows the count exactly.

**Stats:** Guard 16, Vitality 16
**Combat:** Battle Axe (+2): 2d6+2 damage
**Special:** Aggressive - can move one extra zone when moving toward an enemy. Battle Fury - gains +1 damage when below half Guard.
**Tactics:** Charges into melee. Targets whoever wounded her most recently. Will accept surrender if offered food or valuables for her tribe.

_Orc warriors typically have Guard 14-18. Veterans like Grakka are on the higher end. Orc champions leading war parties may have Guard 20-24._

---

## Skeleton Warrior

### Sir Aldric's Bones

_Remains of a knight still bound by ancient oaths_

**Motivation:** Sir Aldric swore to guard the tomb of King Varen forever. He died. The oath didn't. Now his bones patrol the crypt, attacking anyone who disturbs the king's rest - exactly as he promised, six hundred years ago.

**Appearance:** A skeleton in rusted plate armor, still holding a notched longsword. The crest on his shield is worn but recognizable - House Aldric, loyal servants of the crown. His movements are jerky but purposeful.

**Stats:** Guard 14, Vitality 12
**Combat:** Longsword (+1): 1d6+2 damage; Shield provides +1 Guard
**Special:** Undead - immune to poison, disease, fear, and mental effects. Vulnerable to bludgeoning (takes +2 damage).
**Tactics:** Patrols set routes. Attacks intruders but won't pursue beyond the tomb. Can be "dismissed" by a descendant of King Varen or by laying the king's spirit to rest.

_Skeleton warriors typically have Guard 12-16 depending on their equipment and the power of the magic animating them. Skeletons of legendary warriors may retain some combat skill._

---

## Vampire Spawn

### Lady Isadora's Children

_Enthralled servants of a vampire noble_

**Motivation:** These spawn have no true will - they exist to serve Lady Isadora, their creator. They hunger constantly but can only feed when she permits. They were once people with lives and dreams; now they're weapons.

**Appearance:** Pale figures in aristocratic clothing, now stained and torn. Their eyes hold desperate hunger and faint echoes of who they were. Some still wear wedding rings or carry personal trinkets they can't remember the meaning of.

**Stats:** Guard 22, Vitality 28, Momentum 3
**Combat:** Claws (+3): 1d6+2 damage; Bite (+2): 1d6+3 damage and heals the spawn for half damage dealt
**Special:**

- Regenerates 3 Vitality per round unless in sunlight or running water
- Can climb walls and ceilings
- Charming Gaze: Target must save or be unable to attack the spawn for 1 round
- Sunlight Vulnerability: Takes 2d6 damage per round in direct sunlight

**Tactics:** Attempt to separate one victim from the group. Use Charming Gaze to neutralize threats. Flee to Lady Isadora if overwhelmed.

_Vampire spawn typically have Guard 18-24. They're dangerous individually; in groups of 3-5, they can threaten experienced adventurers. True vampires like Lady Isadora are far more powerful._

---

## Werewolf

### Fenris Darkpelt

_Cursed hunter who has embraced the beast_

**Motivation:** Fenris was a ranger who contracted lycanthropy fifteen years ago. He's stopped fighting it. Now he leads a pack of similarly afflicted hunters who've retreated from civilization. They protect their territory fiercely but don't hunt humans unless provoked.

**Appearance:** In human form, a grizzled woodsman with amber eyes and silver-streaked hair. In hybrid form, a seven-foot wolf-man with matted grey fur and too-human intelligence in his eyes.

**Stats (hybrid form):** Guard 26, Vitality 30, Momentum 4
**Combat:** Claws (+3): 2d6+2 damage; Bite (+3): 2d6+3 damage
**Special:**

- Shapechanger: Can shift between human, wolf, and hybrid forms
- Regenerates 2 Vitality per round unless damaged by silver
- Keen senses - cannot be surprised
- Lycanthropic Bite: Creatures reduced to 0 Vitality by bite must save or contract lycanthropy

**Tactics:** Prefers hybrid form for combat. Uses pack tactics with wolf allies. Targets silver-carrying enemies first. Will negotiate in human form if territory isn't threatened.

_Werewolves typically have Guard 22-28 in hybrid form. Pack alphas like Fenris are on the higher end. Werewolf packs usually include 2-4 infected hunters plus 4-8 normal wolves._

---

## Wizard, Archmage

### Archmage Lysara Vorn, the Betrayer

_Former hero corrupted by forbidden knowledge_

**Motivation:** Lysara was once the realm's greatest defender. Then she discovered the truth - the gods are parasites feeding on mortal faith. She's determined to "free" humanity by destroying the divine, no matter the cost. She believes she's still a hero.

**Appearance:** An elegant woman who appears forty but is over two hundred. Her silver hair floats as if underwater. Her eyes occasionally shift colors mid-conversation. She speaks calmly about apocalyptic plans as if discussing weather.

**Stats:** Guard 38, Vitality 45, Momentum 6
**Combat:** Staff of Power (+3): 1d6+2 damage
**Spells (vast repertoire including):**

- Meteor Swarm (8d6 damage in large area)
- Time Stop (take 1d4+1 extra turns)
- Imprisonment (trap target in extradimensional prison)
- Wish (reshape reality - extreme cost)
- Counterspell, Teleport, Shield (defensive options)

**Special:**

- Legendary Resistance: 3/day, auto-succeed on saves
- Contingency: If reduced below 20 Vitality, automatically teleports to prepared safe location
- Magic Resistance: Advantage on saves against spells
- Lair: In her tower, Lysara can manipulate local reality

**Tactics:** Never fights fair. Uses Contingency to escape if threatened. Prefers to send summoned creatures while she prepares greater magic. If cornered, uses Time Stop to set up overwhelming offense.

_Archmages are among the most dangerous mortals alive. Their power varies enormously - Lysara is exceptional even among her peers. Confronting an archmage requires either catching them unprepared or having equivalent magical resources._

---

## Zombie

### Thom Barley, Once a Miller

_Animated corpse driven by necromantic hunger_

**Motivation:** Thom has no motivation anymore. The man who loved his wife, raised two children, and ground grain for the village is gone. What remains shambles toward the living, driven by magic it doesn't understand.

**Appearance:** A bloated corpse in a miller's apron, still dusted with flour. One arm hangs at a wrong angle. His eyes are clouded but track movement. His wedding ring is still on his finger.

**Stats:** Guard 12, Vitality 14
**Combat:** Slam (+1): 1d6+1 damage
**Special:** Undead Fortitude - the first time a zombie would be reduced to 0 Vitality each scene, it instead drops to 1 Vitality (destroyed by critical hits or radiant damage). Slow - always acts last in initiative.
**Tactics:** Shuffles toward nearest living creature. No tactics, no self-preservation, no mercy. Can be destroyed permanently or laid to rest through appropriate rituals.

_Zombies typically have Guard 10-14. Fresh corpses are more resilient; long-dead zombies may crumble more easily. Mass-raised zombies in armies tend to be weaker individually but terrifying in numbers._

---

## Creating Your Own Adversaries

The creatures above are examples and inspirations - your campaign will need many more. Here's how to approach creating adversaries:

### Start With the Story

Before writing any statistics, answer these questions:

- **Who is this person (or creature)?** Give them a name and history.
- **What do they want?** Their motivation drives their actions.
- **Why would they oppose the characters?** Conflict should feel natural, not forced.
- **What would make them stop fighting?** Not every conflict ends in death.

### Then Add Appropriate Statistics

**Guard and Vitality Guidelines:**

_For quick reference, here are typical ranges. These are not formulas - adjust freely._

Inexperienced or fragile opponents (new recruits, wild animals, simple undead):

- Guard 8-14, Vitality 8-14

Trained combatants (professional soldiers, dangerous predators, skilled bandits):

- Guard 14-20, Vitality 14-24

Veteran warriors or magical creatures (experienced guards, young dragons, vampire spawn):

- Guard 20-32, Vitality 24-40

Legendary threats (ancient dragons, demon lords, archmages):

- Guard 35-60, Vitality 40-70

**Combat Modifiers:**

- Untrained: +0 to +1
- Trained: +2 to +3
- Expert: +4 to +5

### Give Them Personality in Combat

Two orcs with identical statistics can feel completely different:

- One fights with cold efficiency, targeting the weakest party member
- One howls battle cries and charges the biggest threat

**Tactical Notes for Each Adversary:**

- What do they do when winning?
- What do they do when losing?
- Will they surrender? Negotiate? Flee?
- Do they protect each other or save themselves?

### Remember: Stats Serve Story

If a scene needs a dangerous mercenary captain, don't calculate "appropriate Guard for party milestone level." Ask: "How tough should Captain Vex be for this story?" Then assign statistics that make that story work.

Sometimes the right answer is "too tough to fight directly." That's not unfair - it's dramatic.
