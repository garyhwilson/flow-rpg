# MONSTERS & NPCS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Monsters Effectively

This guide helps you leverage the monster system to create engaging, dynamic encounters that feel natural within the Flow economy.

## Encounter Building Basics

### Party Size & Threat Assessment

**Standard Party:** 4 players

**Encounter Budget by Difficulty:**

**Easy Encounter:**
- 4-6 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 2-3 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1

**Moderate Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 2-4 Threat 1 minions, OR
- 3-4 Threat 2 standard enemies, OR
- 2 Threat 2 + 3-4 Threat 1

**Hard Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 3 champion + 1 Threat 2 + 2-3 Threat 1, OR
- 2 Threat 3 champions, OR
- 5-6 Threat 2 standard enemies

**Deadly Encounter:**
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary (solo), OR
- 1 Threat 4 legendary adversary + supporting minions, OR
- 3 Threat 3 champions

### Scaling for Party Size

**3-Player Party:**
- Reduce enemy count by 1-2
- Or reduce one enemy's threat level
- Consider giving players +1 starting Flow

**5-6 Player Party:**
- Add 1-2 more enemies
- Or increase one enemy's threat level
- Or add environmental challenges

## Flow Management for Encounters

### Starting Flow

**Monsters:**
- Minions (Threat 1): 0-1 Flow
- Standard (Threat 2): 2-3 Flow
- Champion (Threat 3): 4-6 Flow
- Legendary (Threat 4): 8-12 Flow

**Players:**
- Ambush/surprise: Start at 0-2 Flow
- Standard start: 3-5 Flow (from previous encounter or scene)
- Prepared/advantageous: 5-7 Flow

### Flow During Combat

**Players Generate Flow By:**
- Successful attacks in Aggressive Stance (+1 Flow)
- Building in Defensive Stance (+1 Flow per turn)
- Defeating monsters (+1 Flow per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- Using certain calling benefits

**Monsters Generate Flow By:**
- Same rules as players (if intelligent enough)
- Minions typically don't manage Flow tactically
- Standard+ enemies can use Flow economy

**Result:** Players typically accumulate Flow advantage as combat progresses, creating dramatic momentum toward victory.

## Monster Tactics by Intelligence

## Tactical Positioning

### Zones in Combat

Recall the zone system:
- **Close:** Melee range (same zone)
- **Near:** Short range (adjacent zone)
- **Far:** Long range (2+ zones away)

### Monster Positioning Tactics

**Minion Swarms:**
- Surround single targets
- Block escape routes
- Force area effect targets

**Ranged Attackers:**
- Stay at Far range
- Use cover
- Focus fire with allies

**Spellcasters:**
- Stay at Near/Far range
- Behind frontline
- Positioned for area effects

**Champions/Legendary:**
- Control center of battlefield
- Force players to come to them
- Use lair advantages

## Monster Abilities & Flow

### When to Use Abilities

**1-Flow Abilities:**
- Use early and often
- Save one for emergency
- Standard enemies can afford 2-3 per fight

**3-Flow Abilities:**
- Save for critical moments
- Champion enemies can afford 1-2 per fight
- Use when it will turn the tide

**5-Flow Abilities:**
- Legendary adversaries only usually
- Save for dramatic moments
- Use when players think they're winning

### Telegraphing Big Attacks

When a monster is about to use a powerful ability:
1. **Describe the wind-up** ("The dragon's throat glows with building flame...")
2. **Give players a chance to react** (ready defense, move, interrupt)
3. **Execute dramatically** (describe the awesome effect)

This creates tension without feeling cheap.

## Monster Death & Flow

### Defeat Generates Flow

When a monster is defeated:
- **Threat 1-3:** Players gain +1 Flow (distributed to attacking player or party)
- **Threat 4:** Players gain +2 Flow

### Morale & Retreat

Intelligent monsters should retreat when:
- Leader/champion defeated
- Reduced to 25% of original force
- Clearly losing

Don't fight every battle to total annihilation—retreating enemies:
- Create recurring villains
- Feel more realistic
- Can return with reinforcements
- Provide information to players

## Special Situations

### Monster Spellcasting

Monsters can cast spells using the flexible system:
- Choose appropriate attribute (Mind for wizards, Will for clerics, etc.)
- Pay Flow costs
- Use same spell rules as PCs

**GM Shortcut:** Pre-select which attribute each monster caster uses to speed play.

### Monsters vs. Callings

Player callings interact with monsters:
- **Explorer:** Might trigger on first encounter with creature type
- **Scholar:** Can use knowledge to identify weaknesses
- **Protector:** Gets benefits when allies threatened
- **Avenger:** Might have specific enemy types
- **Ascendant:** Legendary adversaries provide great moments

Design encounters that let callings shine.

### Monsters vs. Stances

**Against Aggressive Players:**
- Focus fire to force Defensive switches
- Use crowd control
- Spread damage around

**Against Defensive Players:**
- Force them to act (threaten NPCs, time pressure)
- Area effects hit defensive targets
- Wear down resources

**Against Balanced Players:**
- Adapt to their tactics
- Create situations forcing stance switches
- Reward tactical play

## Environmental Factors

### Lair Advantages

Legendary adversaries in their lairs might have:
- **Environmental hazards** (lava, falling rocks)
- **Minion reinforcements** (arrive each round)
- **Terrain advantages** (high ground, cover)
- **Magical effects** (darkness, silence zones)

### Using Terrain

**Elevation:**
- High ground grants advantage
- Low ground restricts visibility
- Falling damage is real

**Cover:**
- Grants defense bonus
- Blocks line of sight
- Can be destroyed

**Obstacles:**
- Require movement to navigate
- Create tactical positioning
- Force ranged vs. melee decisions

**Hazards:**
- Damage per turn
- Require saves/checks
- Change battlefield

## Encounter Pacing

### Opening (Rounds 1-2)

**Goals:**
- Establish positioning
- Set up combos
- Assess threats

**Monster Tactics:**
- Aggressive opening
- Use terrain
- Spread damage

### Middle (Rounds 3-4)

**Goals:**
- Execute strategies
- Adapt to threats
- Manage resources

**Monster Tactics:**
- Focus fire
- Use key abilities
- Coordinate attacks

### Climax (Rounds 5+)

**Goals:**
- Finish the fight
- Spend remaining resources
- Heroic moments

**Monster Tactics:**
- Desperate measures
- Big abilities
- All-in attacks

**Note:** Most fights should resolve in 4-6 rounds. Longer = potential slog.

## Running Multiple Monsters

### Group Initiative

To speed play:
- **Group by type:** All goblins act together
- **Clear turn order:** Players → Minions → Champions → Legendary
- **Fast resolution:** Roll all attacks at once

### Tracking HP & Flow

**Techniques:**
- Index cards for each monster/group
- Dry-erase battle mat with stats
- Note pad with quick tallies
- Digital tools if preferred

**What to Track:**
- Current Vitality
- Current Flow
- Status effects
- Used abilities

### Speeding Combat

**Do:**
- Pre-roll damage
- Group similar monsters
- Have stat blocks ready
- Describe attacks quickly

**Don't:**
- Recalculate basics every turn
- Narrate every mundane attack
- Let monster turns drag
- Over-complicate

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Too Many Monsters

**Problem:** Combat becomes tedious
**Solution:** Use fewer, more interesting monsters. 6-8 enemies max usually.

### Mistake: Ignoring Flow Economy

**Problem:** Monsters don't feel integrated
**Solution:** Track monster Flow, use abilities tactically

### Mistake: Monsters Fight to Death

**Problem:** Unrealistic, prevents recurring villains
**Solution:** Smart enemies retreat at 25% strength

### Mistake: No Tactical Variety

**Problem:** Every fight feels same
**Solution:** Mix threat levels, use terrain, vary tactics

### Mistake: Overwhelming Opening

**Problem:** Players feel helpless early
**Solution:** Build difficulty, use minions early, save champions for middle

## Improvising Monsters

Need a monster on the fly?

### 30-Second Monster

1. **Threat Level:** Based on party level and desired difficulty
2. **Vitality:** Use threat level guidelines
3. **Guard:** 7 + threat level + 1d4
4. **Attack:** 2d6 + threat level
5. **One Simple Ability:** Costs 1 Flow, does something interesting

**Example:** Sudden ambush by bandits? Threat 2, Vitality 10, Guard 10, Attack 2d6+2, Ability: "Smoke Bomb" (1 Flow - create obscurement, escape).

### Scaling Existing Monsters

**Make Easier:**
- Reduce Vitality by 25%
- Reduce starting Flow by 2
- Remove one ability

**Make Harder:**
- Increase Vitality by 50%
- Increase starting Flow by 2-3
- Add one ability
- Increase attributes by +1

## Creating Memorable Fights

### Elements of Great Encounters

1. **Clear Stakes:** What happens if players lose?
2. **Interesting Terrain:** More than empty room
3. **Tactical Choices:** Multiple valid approaches
4. **Dramatic Pacing:** Build to climax
5. **Character Moments:** Let PCs shine

### Set-Piece Battles

**Legendary Adversary Phases:**
- Phase 1: Initial tactics (full strength)
- Phase 2: Escalation at 50% (desperation, new abilities)
- Phase 3: Final stand at 25% (all-out, environmental collapse)

**Waves:**
- Wave 1: Initial enemies
- Wave 2: Reinforcements arrive (round 3)
- Wave 3: Champion/legendary shows up (round 5)

**Environmental Changes:**
- Building collapses
- Fire spreads
- Water rises
- Darkness falls

## Encounter as Story

Every combat tells a story:
- **Setup:** Who, where, why
- **Complication:** Unexpected element
- **Climax:** Critical moment
- **Resolution:** Consequences

Don't just run fights—narrate battles that players remember.
