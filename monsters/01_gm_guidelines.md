# RUNNING ADVERSARIES

This guide helps you bring adversaries to life at the table, making combat encounters memorable and narratively satisfying.

## Before the Fight

### Know Your Adversary

Before combat begins, answer these questions:

**Who are they?**

- Name (always give them one, even if players never learn it)
- Role in the world (guard captain, pack leader, ancient protector)
- Current emotional state (confident, desperate, enraged, curious)

**What do they want?**

- Immediate goal (kill intruders, defend territory, capture alive)
- Underlying motivation (loyalty, fear, hunger, duty)
- What would make them stop (surrender accepted, warning delivered, enough food secured)

**How do they fight?**

- Preferred tactics (aggressive charge, defensive positioning, hit-and-run)
- Who do they target (weakest opponent, biggest threat, whoever hurt them)
- What triggers a change in behavior (ally falls, takes significant damage, objectives threatened)

### Set the Scene

Combat happens somewhere. Before initiative:

- **Describe the environment** - What can players see, hear, smell?
- **Note interactive elements** - Tables to overturn, chandeliers to drop, doors to bar
- **Establish lighting and terrain** - Does anyone have an advantage?
- **Place the adversaries** - Where are they when combat begins?

A fight in a crowded tavern feels different from a fight in that same tavern when it's empty at midnight.

## During Combat

### Personality Through Action

Make each significant adversary memorable through how they fight:

**The Calculating Captain**

- Calls out tactical orders to allies
- Targets healers and spellcasters first
- Uses terrain advantages methodically
- Offers surrender when victory is assured

**The Berserker**

- Howls and charges the nearest enemy
- Ignores wounds to press the attack
- Targets whoever wounded them most recently
- Never retreats, but might be talked down with shows of strength

**The Coward**

- Hangs back behind allies
- Uses ranged attacks or spells from cover
- Flees the moment the fight turns
- Might betray allies to save themselves

### Running Multiple Adversaries

When facing groups:

**Group by similarity** - All the guards act on the same initiative
**Vary their actions** - Some attack, some position, some use abilities
**Track individuals roughly** - "Two guards are wounded, one is fresh"

### When Adversaries Should Retreat

Intelligent adversaries flee when:

- Their leader falls (unless seeking revenge)
- They're clearly losing and can escape
- The cost exceeds the benefit (risking death for a patrol mission?)
- They need to warn others or get reinforcements

This isn't weakness - it's intelligent behavior. It also:

- Creates recurring villains
- Gives players valuable prisoners
- Makes the world feel alive
- Prevents every fight from being to the death

### Making Powerful Foes Threatening

Major adversaries should feel dangerous. Techniques to achieve this:

**Multiple actions:** A dragon can bite, claw, and breathe fire. Limit attacks to 2 per round to avoid instant player deaths, but that third action can be movement, magical effects, or environmental manipulation.

**Legendary resistance:** "The spell washes over the demon lord, who merely laughs. That power won't work on me." Use sparingly - 2-3 times per fight.

**Environmental control:** In their lair, the adversary controls the battlefield. Lava rises, walls shift, darkness falls, reinforcements arrive.

**Focused pressure:** Target one player character intensely (but not exclusively). The party must adapt tactics to protect that character.

## Momentum in Combat

### Adversary Momentum

Adversaries use Momentum like player characters:

- **Starting Momentum** depends on the adversary (see bestiary entries)
- **Generating Momentum** through stance bonuses and successful attacks
- **Spending Momentum** on abilities, enhanced attacks, defensive reactions

Intelligent adversaries should manage Momentum tactically. A goblin shaman saves Momentum for emergency healing. A demon lord spends freely, confident in power. A cornered bandit burns everything on desperation attacks.

### Momentum When Adversaries Fall

When players defeat an adversary, they gain +1 Momentum. This creates natural momentum - as the fight progresses, players accumulate resources and gain advantage.

For particularly significant victories (defeating a major villain, saving the town), consider awarding +2 Momentum or other narrative rewards.

## Common Situations

### Ambushes

When adversaries ambush the party:

- Describe the setup before springing the trap
- Give players a chance to notice (Awareness check)
- Even failed checks might give partial warning
- Position matters more than raw damage

When players ambush adversaries:

- Let their planning pay off
- Adversaries who survive might flee or surrender quickly
- Don't punish clever play with sudden reinforcements

### Hostage Situations

When adversaries have leverage:

- Make the hostage sympathetic (name them!)
- Give adversaries clear demands
- Let negotiation be a real option
- Have consequences for both success and failure

### Fighting Retreat

When adversaries retreat while fighting:

- Each round, they move toward escape
- They use delaying tactics (overturning furniture, throwing smoke)
- They might leave wounded behind or try to rescue them
- Pursuit has risks - running into ambushes, traps, reinforcements

## After Combat

### Aftermath

Combat has consequences:

- **Wounded adversaries** - Do players stabilize them or let them die?
- **Prisoners** - What do players do with captured foes?
- **Survivors who fled** - Will they return with reinforcements? Spread news?
- **The environment** - Is the building on fire? Are innocents hurt?

### Information and Loot

Defeated adversaries provide:

- **Information** - What do they know? Will they talk?
- **Equipment** - Weapons, armor, items they were carrying
- **Connections** - Who do they work for? Who will miss them?
- **Story hooks** - Letters, maps, orders, personal effects

### Recurring Adversaries

Foes who escape can return:

- **Improved** - They've trained, recruited allies, prepared countermeasures
- **Changed** - Their defeat changed them (humbled, enraged, obsessed)
- **Informed** - They know the party's tactics and have adapted
- **Connected** - They've allied with other threats

The bandit who escaped in session 2 returning as a mercenary captain in session 8, still bearing the scar from your fighter's blade, creates stories no random encounter can match.

## Keeping Combat Moving

### Pacing

Most combats should resolve in 4-6 rounds. Longer fights risk becoming tedious.

**If combat is dragging:**

- Adversaries make decisive moves (all-out attacks, dramatic retreats)
- Environmental changes force action (building collapses, reinforcements arrive)
- Narratively resolve the end ("With their leader fallen, the remaining bandits throw down their weapons")

### Group Initiatives

To speed play with multiple adversaries:

- All similar adversaries act on the same initiative
- Roll attacks for groups simultaneously
- Track damage to groups, not individuals ("The guard patrol has taken 30 damage total, two are down")

### Know When to End

When the outcome is obvious:

- Offer surrender terms
- Describe the conclusion narratively
- Move on to consequences and aftermath

Don't force players to roll through every remaining hit point when victory is assured.

## Creating Memorable Fights

### Elements That Matter

**Clear stakes** - What happens if players lose? What happens if they win?

**Meaningful choices** - Should they focus the leader or thin the ranks? Save the hostage or stop the ritual? Fight or flee?

**Environmental interaction** - The chandelier drops, the bridge collapses, the magical circle flares

**Character moments** - Let individual players shine. Let adversaries target specific characters. Create stories.

### What to Avoid

**Bags of hit points** - If the only interesting thing is how long it takes to reduce the adversary to zero, the fight needs work

**Interchangeable foes** - "Another 4 goblins attack" is less interesting than "Skrix brings three of his brothers to avenge their tribe"

**Fights to the death** - Not every combat needs to end with bodies. Surrender, retreat, and negotiation are all valid endings.

**Solving everything with combat** - Sometimes the most interesting choice is whether to fight at all

## Quick Reminders

**Before combat:**

- Name your adversaries
- Know what they want
- Prepare the environment

**During combat:**

- Give adversaries personality
- Use Momentum tactically
- Let adversaries retreat when sensible

**After combat:**

- Consequences matter
- Survivors remember
- Stories continue

_The best combat encounters are ones your players remember as stories, not as dice rolls. Give your adversaries names, motivations, and personalities - then let them loose._
