# ADVERSARIES & CREATURES

## A Different Approach

This chapter presents adversaries differently than you might expect. Instead of stat blocks organized by power level or combat role, you'll find named characters with motivations, personalities, and reasons to oppose your players.

Every adversary in Autumn Phoenix RPG should be a character first and a set of statistics second.

## The Core Principle

Before you assign any numbers, answer these questions:

1. **Who is this person (or creature)?** Give them a name.
2. **What do they want?** Their motivation drives their actions.
3. **Why would they oppose the characters?** Conflict should feel natural.
4. **What would make them stop fighting?** Not every conflict ends in death.

A bandit named Mal who robs travelers because he owes money to a dangerous creditor is infinitely more interesting than "Bandit, Guard 12, Vitality 10." Mal might surrender if the party offers to help with his debt. He might beg for mercy. He might become a reluctant ally. The numbered bandit just... attacks until dead.

## How to Use This Section

### The Bestiary

The [bestiary.md](bestiary.md) contains example adversaries - named characters with personalities, motivations, and statistics. These are meant as inspiration, not a catalog to fill encounter slots from.

When you need opposition for your game:

1. Find an adversary that fits your story
2. Adapt their motivation to your situation
3. Adjust statistics if needed (guidance follows)
4. Give them a name if they don't have one

### Creating Your Own

Most of your adversaries should be your own creations tailored to your campaign. The bestiary shows the format and approach; your imagination provides the content.

## Statistics in Service of Story

### Guard and Vitality

Guard represents how hard someone is to hurt - armor, toughness, defensive skill. Vitality represents how much punishment they can take before falling.

Here are typical ranges to help you assign appropriate values:

**Inexperienced or fragile opponents** - new recruits, wild animals, desperate civilians

- Guard 8-14, Vitality 8-14

**Trained combatants** - professional soldiers, dangerous predators, skilled criminals

- Guard 14-20, Vitality 14-24

**Veterans and magical creatures** - experienced warriors, young dragons, vampire spawn

- Guard 20-32, Vitality 24-40

**Legendary threats** - ancient dragons, demon lords, archmages

- Guard 35-60, Vitality 40-70

These are starting points, not formulas. If your story needs a grizzled veteran city guard who's tougher than most knights, give him Guard 28. If it needs a young dragon who's sickly and weak, drop the numbers. The story dictates the stats, not vice versa.

### Combat Modifiers

Creatures attack and defend using the same 2d6 + modifier system as player characters.

- Untrained or clumsy: +0 to +1
- Trained combatants: +2 to +3
- Experts and dangerous creatures: +4 to +5

### Momentum

Adversaries can use Momentum just like player characters. Consider:

- Most minor opponents start with 0-2 Momentum
- Skilled adversaries might start with 3-4 Momentum
- Major villains might start with 5-6 Momentum

Intelligent adversaries should spend Momentum on abilities tactically, just like players do.

## Making Combat Interesting

### Personality in Combat

Two adversaries with identical statistics can feel completely different:

**Captain Sera Blackthorn** fights with cold efficiency, always targeting the weakest party member, coordinating her soldiers with crisp orders. She'll accept surrender because dead prisoners can't be interrogated.

**Grakka Blood-Axe** howls battle cries and charges the biggest threat, fighting for glory above all. She'll accept surrender only if impressed by the party's prowess - and might recruit them instead.

Give each significant adversary:

- A fighting style that reflects their personality
- Conditions under which they'd stop fighting
- A tactical preference (cautious, aggressive, protective of allies, self-preserving)

### Retreat and Surrender

Not every fight ends in death. Intelligent adversaries should:

- Flee when clearly losing (unless motivated otherwise)
- Surrender when defeat is certain (if they believe mercy possible)
- Use tactical retreats to regroup

This creates:

- Recurring villains
- Opportunities for negotiation
- Information for players
- A more realistic world

### Environmental Storytelling

Combat happens in places, not on blank maps. Consider:

- **Terrain that matters** - high ground, cover, obstacles, hazards
- **Interactive elements** - chandeliers to drop, tables to overturn, doors to bar
- **Time pressure** - the building is on fire, reinforcements are coming, the ritual is nearly complete

## Powerful Adversaries

Some adversaries - ancient dragons, demon lords, legendary archmages - are beyond normal threats. These require special consideration.

### Multiple Actions

Very powerful creatures might act more than once per round. A dragon might:

- Bite one character
- Sweep its tail at another
- Breathe fire on a group

**Important guidance:** Limit attacks to 2 per round maximum, even for powerful foes. Three or more attacks focused on one character tends to result in instant death, which rarely makes for a good story.

The third action can be movement, a defensive stance, using the environment, or a non-damaging ability.

### Legendary Resistance

Major villains might be able to shrug off effects that would instantly end a lesser creature. When a player lands a devastating spell, you can declare the villain resists it through sheer will or magical protection.

Use this sparingly - perhaps 2-3 times per battle. Players should feel their abilities matter; this just prevents anticlimactic endings.

### Lair Advantages

When fighting in their lair, powerful creatures might have:

- Environmental hazards they're immune to
- Reinforcements that arrive to assist
- Magical effects woven into the location
- Escape routes only they know

This makes where you fight as important as who you fight.

## Final Thoughts

The adversaries in your game are characters, not obstacles. Give them names. Give them reasons. Let them surprise you and your players.

A world full of named individuals with their own agendas is infinitely richer than a world full of stat blocks waiting to be killed.
