# MONSTERS & NPCS - INTRODUCTION

## Overview

Monsters and NPCs in Flow RPG are designed using the same Flow economy that drives player characters. This creates dynamic, engaging encounters where every action matters and the tactical interplay between players and adversaries flows naturally from the core mechanics.

## Design Philosophy

### Flow-Based Balance

Monsters aren't balanced by hit points and damage—they're balanced by their relationship to the Flow economy:

- **Minions** generate Flow for players through easy defeats
- **Standard enemies** create balanced Flow exchanges
- **Champions** challenge players' Flow management
- **Legendary adversaries** force critical resource decisions

### Simple but Tactical

Monster stat blocks are intentionally streamlined:
- **Easy to run** at the table
- **Clear motivations** drive tactical decisions
- **Interesting abilities** without excessive complexity
- **Scalable** through simple modifications

### Integrated with Core Systems

Monsters work with the same rules as PCs:
- Use the same Flow economy
- Follow stance rules (when applicable)
- Cast spells using the flexible system
- Interact with all PC abilities naturally

## Threat Levels

Monsters are categorized by threat level, which determines their role in encounters and relationship to the Flow economy.

**Examples:** Goblin scouts, bandits, giant rats, zombies

**Flow Impact:**
- Generate +1 Flow for players when defeated
- Rarely have enough Flow to use abilities
- Exist to be mowed down and generate resources

**Encounter Use:**

## Quick Monster Creation

To create a monster quickly:

### 1. Choose Threat Level
Determines baseline stats and Flow

### 2. Set Core Stats
- **Vitality:** Threat 1 = 3-6, Threat 2 = 8-12, Threat 3 = 14-20, Threat 4 = 25-40+
- **Guard:** Threat 1 = 6-8, Threat 2 = 9-11, Threat 3 = 12-14, Threat 4 = 15-18+
- **Starting Flow:** Threat 1 = 0-1, Threat 2 = 2-3, Threat 3 = 4-6, Threat 4 = 8-12

### 3. Assign Attributes
- **Primary:** The monster's key strength (+2 to +4)
- **Secondary:** Supporting attributes (+0 to +2)
- **Weak:** Dump stats (-1 to 0)

### 4. Create Attacks
- **Damage:** 2d6 + relevant attribute
- **Range:** Based on concept
- **Special Properties:** Keep it simple (1-2 max)

### 5. Add 1-3 Abilities
- **Cost Flow** appropriately
- **Match threat level** (minions get simple abilities, legendary adversaries get complex ones)
- **Support tactics** and role

### 6. Write Tactics Section
- How does it fight?
- When does it use abilities?
- What are its goals?

## Flow Dynamics in Combat

Understanding how monsters interact with the Flow economy:

### Flow Generation
- **Players generate Flow** by defeating monsters (+1 per monster, +2 for legendary adversaries)
- **Players generate Flow** through successful attacks in Aggressive Stance
- **Monsters generate Flow** the same way (if intelligent/tactical)

### Flow Usage
- **Minions** rarely use abilities (no Flow)
- **Standard enemies** use 1-Flow abilities tactically
- **Champions** can afford multiple abilities
- **Legendary adversaries** manage Flow like PCs

### Encounter Pacing
- **Start:** Players often at moderate Flow, monsters at starting value
- **Middle:** Flow exchanges as attacks succeed, abilities fire
- **End:** Players have accumulated Flow from defeats, finish strong

This creates natural dramatic pacing where players build momentum through the encounter.
