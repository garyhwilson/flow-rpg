# Arborian

_The Season-Bound_

## Origin & Lore

Living extensions of nature itself, Arborians are grove-born beings whose appearance and abilities shift with their chosen seasonal aspect. They embody the eternal cycle of growth, harvest, death, and renewal that defines the natural world.

### Botanic Form
Immune to magical sleep; require only 4 hours of sunlight rest. Your plant-like physiology processes rest differently, drawing sustenance from light rather than unconsciousness.

## Cultural Tendencies

Arborians often serve as guardians of sacred groves or advisors on natural cycles. They understand that all things have their season and that death enables rebirth. Many become druids, gardeners, or philosophers of the Phoenix Cycle.

## Playing an Arborian

Choose your season based on your character concept and desired attribute bonus. Your Seasonal Pulse provides versatile options—coordinate with your party about when to use it. Your immunity to magical sleep can be crucial against certain enemies.
