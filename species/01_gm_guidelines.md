# Species GM Guidelines

_Advice for Game Masters on Integrating Species into Campaigns_

## Core Principles

### Species as Context, Not Destiny

Species provides starting points rather than determining personality or values:

- **Individual Variation:** Every species encompasses diverse personalities and approaches
- **Cultural Exposure:** Upbringing may differ from species stereotypes
- **Conscious Relationship:** Characters can embrace, reject, or blend their heritage

### Avoiding Stereotypes

- Present each species as having diverse, complex societies with internal variation
- Frame species-typical behaviors as cultural adaptations, not inherent traits
- Allow characters to grow beyond initial cultural limitations through experience

## Species-Specific Guidance

### Human — The Adaptable Survivors

**Showcasing Diversity:** Humans have the most internal cultural variation. Present human communities with distinctly different values and practices rather than a homogeneous culture.

**Temporal Perspective:** Create scenarios where their shorter lifespan shapes their approach—rapid adaptation, compressed learning, decisions with consequences beyond their lifetime.

**Bridging Role:** Humans often serve as intermediaries between other species due to their presence throughout Autumn Phoenix and diplomatic flexibility.

### Elf — The Memory-Bound Mystics

**Beyond Forest Dwellers:** Present diverse elven cultures including urban communities, academic traditions, and innovative subcultures.

**Temporal Disconnect:** Create moments highlighting their experience of time through interactions with shorter-lived species or century-long patterns.

**Resonance Connection:** Offer opportunities to perceive magical patterns, sense Resonance disturbances, or recall forgotten lore.

### Dwarf — The Stoneborn Builders

**Cultural Depth:** Explore their artistic traditions, governance systems, and philosophical approaches beyond mining stereotypes.

**Ancestral Connection:** Create moments highlighting their relationship with lineage through family obligations or historical knowledge.

**Ashcrest Integration:** Connect dwarven communities to the mountain setting and their relationship with the Cliffborn.

### Felisari — The Feline Wanderers

**Beyond Thieves:** While many become information brokers, Felisari also serve as performers, scouts, and curiosity-driven explorers.

**Integration:** They rarely form large communities—show them woven into other societies rather than isolated.

**Curiosity as Motivation:** Their drive to discover can lead to both trouble and breakthrough discoveries.

### Cliffborn — The Mountain Scouts

**Vertical Communities:** Their homes are built into mountainsides, accessible only by climbing—use this for unique location design.

**Wind-Bond Drama:** Save dramatic moments for their fall-reducing ability; it creates memorable scenes.

**Message Networks:** They often serve as messengers between isolated communities—useful for plot hooks.

### Emberkin — The Fire-Touched

**Phoenix Philosophy:** They understand destruction enables creation—use this perspective in moral dilemmas.

**Bloodied Triggers:** Design encounters where their Flame Wake ability creates tactical choices.

**Forge Connections:** Many work with fire professionally—smiths, glassblowers, fire-mages.

### Umbrin — The Shadow Dreamers

**Photosensitivity:** Remember their disadvantage in sunlight creates tactical and social complications.

**Perfect Memory:** Their Umbral Memory ability can solve mysteries—but also burden them with traumatic recall.

**Underground Origins:** Their subterranean heritage creates natural connections to deep places and hidden knowledge.

### Arborian — The Season-Bound

**Seasonal Identity:** Their chosen season shapes their personality and appearance—Spring Arborians differ from Winter ones.

**Unknown Lifespan:** They may have witnessed events centuries ago or be relatively young—this ambiguity creates mystery.

**Phoenix Gardeners:** They understand the cycle of growth, harvest, death, and renewal intimately.

## Handling Interspecies Dynamics

### Productive Tension

- Focus conflicts on specific historical events or resource competitions, not innate incompatibility
- Present all sides as having comprehensible motivations
- Include characters who transcend typical tensions

### Spotlight Balance

- Design adventures with varied challenges playing to different species' strengths
- Remember that Momentum allows characters to overcome natural limitations
- Encourage narrative contributions from species perspective regardless of mechanical advantage

## Mixed Communities

Many compelling character concepts emerge from:

- **Border Settlements:** Hybrid cultures incorporating multiple species
- **Urban Centers:** Cosmopolitan environments like Nix where species intermingle
- **Trade Hubs:** Pragmatic approaches overriding traditional divisions
- **Shared Territories:** Dwarves and Cliffborn in Ashcrest, various species in the Twilight Forest

_The species system provides foundations for worldbuilding and character development when handled with nuance. Present species as complex entities with internal diversity while maintaining their distinctive essence._
