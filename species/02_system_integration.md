### Rank Progression Notes

All species follow the same rank structure, but narrative framing differs:

- **Ranks 3-4:** Achieving mastery in chosen focus
- **Rank 5+:** Legendary status, world-shaping influence

## Species and Proficiencies

Species traits stack with proficiency bonuses:

- A Dwarf with Crafting proficiency gains both the +1 species bonus and proficiency bonus
- A Felisari who chose Stealth for Curiosity's Edge gains both bonuses when being stealthy
- An Umbrin with Stealth proficiency adds their +2 Shadowmeld bonus in dim light

## Creating New Species

When designing additional species for Autumn Phoenix:

1. **Assign 2 attribute points** (+1 to two attributes, or +2 to one with -1 penalty)
2. **Create 3 species traits** providing situational bonuses or unique abilities
3. **Consider Momentum interaction** — at least one trait should engage with the system
4. **Balance power** — no trait should be universally superior
5. **Support narrative** — traits should encourage interesting roleplay
6. **Connect to themes** — Phoenix Cycle, memory, adaptation, or elemental connection

_Species creates qualitatively different gameplay experiences through integration with all major systems. These differences extend beyond attribute adjustments to include Momentum patterns, combat approaches, magical affinities, and development trajectories._
