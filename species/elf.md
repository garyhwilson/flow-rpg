# Elf

_The Memory-Bound Mystics_

## Origin & Lore

Elves are mystics of the Twilight Forest, bound to ancient memories and aligned with the Resonance that flows through all magic. Their long lives grant them perspective on the Phoenix Cycles, and they often serve as keepers of lore that others have forgotten.

## Physical Traits

- **Height:** 5'6" to 6'4"
- **Build:** Slender and graceful
- **Lifespan:** 200-300 years
- **Vision:** Normal

## Attribute Bonuses

+2 Grace, +1 Awareness, -1 Might

## Species Traits

### Resonant Heritage
+1 to saves against magical effects. Your attunement to the Resonance provides natural resistance to hostile magic.

### Keen Mind
Once per long rest, reroll any failed Awareness or Mind-based check. Your centuries of experience and trained perception allow you to catch details others miss.

### Trance Meditation
4 hours of meditation provides the benefit of 8 hours rest. You enter a deep reverie rather than sleeping, remaining semi-aware of your surroundings.

## Cultural Tendencies

Elven societies value memory, tradition, and the subtle harmonies of magic. They often seem distant to shorter-lived species, but this masks deep connections to the Flow and ancient sorrows from ages past.

## Playing an Elf

Your mystical heritage makes you excellent at detecting and resisting magic. Use your Keen Mind strategically for important knowledge or perception checks. Your trance ability provides flexibility during adventures, allowing you to keep watch while others sleep.

**Narrative Themes:**
- Preserving memories across centuries
