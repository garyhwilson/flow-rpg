# Umbrin

_The Shadow Dreamers_

## Origin & Lore

Subterranean dreamkeepers with connections to shadow and memory, the Umbrin emerged from the deep places where light fears to tread. They possess perfect darkvision and an uncanny ability to recall sensory details with absolute precision.

## Physical Traits

- **Height:** 5'4" to 6'2"
- **Build:** Pale or grey skin tones, large light-sensitive eyes
- **Lifespan:** 100-140 years
- **Vision:** Darkvision

## Attribute Bonuses

+2 Awareness, +1 Grace, -1 Might

## Species Traits

### Shadowmeld
+2 to Stealth in dim light or darkness; gain advantage when hiding while stationary. You become one with the shadows, nearly invisible to those who rely on light.

### Eclipse-Blooded
Once per long rest, reroll a failed Will save. Your connection to darkness grants mental resilience against forces that would dominate your mind.

### Umbral Memory
Can perfectly recall one sensory detail from any scene witnessed in the last 24 hours. Your mind captures experiences with crystalline clarity.

### Photosensitive
Disadvantage on rolls in direct sunlight unless wearing protective eyewear. Your eyes, adapted to darkness, struggle with bright light.

## Cultural Tendencies

Umbrin traditionally dwell in underground cities or heavily shaded surface settlements. They value discretion, careful observation, and the preservation of important memories. Many become archivists or spies.

## Playing an Umbrin

Your stealth bonuses make you exceptional infiltrators, but plan for daylight encounters. Use Umbral Memory for investigation and social encounters—perfect recall of a witness's words or a crime scene's details can solve mysteries. Your reroll provides defense against mental attacks.

**Narrative Themes:**
- Memory as sacred duty and dangerous power
- Living between worlds of light and shadow
- Discretion and the weight of secrets kept
- Finding truth in darkness others fear
