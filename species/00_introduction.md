# Species

_Heritage, Physiology & Cultural Context_

## Introduction

In the Autumn Phoenix RPG system, your character's Species represents one of the three foundational pillars of identity, alongside Archetype (professional training) and Calling (psychological motivation). Your character's species shapes their physical capabilities, cultural background, and perspective on the world. Unlike some game systems that treat species as purely mechanical packages of bonuses, Autumn Phoenix RPG approaches species as integrated combinations of physical traits, cultural contexts, and historical experiences.

The four core species—Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, and Humans—represent distinct approaches to life in the world, each with their own physical adaptations, cultural values, and traditional practices. While individual members of each species vary tremendously, these fundamental patterns provide starting points for character development and worldbuilding.

## Species vs. Race

Autumn Phoenix RPG deliberately uses the term "Species" rather than "Race" to emphasize several key design philosophies:

**Biological Reality:** The four playable options represent genuinely different biological species with distinct evolutionary histories, physiological traits, and adaptations. They are not simply variations of humans with cosmetic differences.

**Cultural Context:** Each species embodies distinct cultural traditions reflecting their biological traits, historical experiences, and environmental adaptations. While cultures vary widely within each species, certain foundational patterns persist across different communities.

**Beyond Stereotype:** The game recognizes and respects the tremendous variation within each species while acknowledging shared biological and cultural foundations. Characters are individuals first, influenced but not defined by their species.

## Core Species Characteristics

### Dwarves

Dwarves are characterized by physical resilience, methodical patience, and deep cultural traditions. Their sturdy physiology, extended lifespans, and connection to stone and metal have shaped societies that value craftsmanship, historical continuity, and community obligation.

### Elves

Elves possess remarkable sensory acuity, physical grace, and exceptionally long lifespans. These traits have fostered cultures that emphasize environmental harmony, artistic refinement, and long-term perspective, approaching both problems and opportunities with patience born from centuries of experience.

### Halflings

Halflings combine physical adaptability, strong community bonds, and practical resilience. Their societies emphasize interpersonal connections, adaptive tradition, and finding contentment in daily life while maintaining the flexibility to thrive in changing circumstances.

### Humans

Humans are defined by their adaptability, ambition, and cultural diversity. Their relatively brief lifespans drive innovation and experimentation, creating tremendous cultural variation across different communities while maintaining core human tendencies toward expansion and adaptation.

## Species in Character Creation

During character creation, your choice of species influences several aspects of your character:

**Attribute Adjustments:** Each species has natural tendencies toward certain physical and mental traits, reflected in attribute modifications.

**Cultural Skills:** Growing up within species-specific cultural contexts provides exposure to particular skills and knowledge areas.

**Special Abilities:** Distinctive biological traits provide unique capabilities differentiating each species.

**Perspective and Values:** Each species approaches the world through specific cultural lenses shaping their priorities and methods.

**Lifespan Considerations:** The dramatically different lifespans between species (particularly humans vs. elves) create different approaches to time, commitment, and change.

These elements provide starting points rather than limitations—individual characters frequently develop against type, embodying unique expressions of their heritage.

## Interspecies Relations

The four species have complex relationships with each other shaped by biological differences, historical interactions, and cultural misconceptions:

**Dwarves and Elves** share extended lifespans but often clash due to fundamentally different values regarding natural resources and environmental intervention.

**Halflings and Humans** frequently coexist in shared communities, though their different perspectives on ambition and contentment sometimes create tension.

**Humans and Elves** maintain complex relationships balancing human adaptability against elven experience, sometimes developing deep friendships despite dramatically different timeframes.

**Dwarves and Halflings** often appreciate each other's practical approaches to problem-solving while maintaining distinct cultural identities.

These relationships vary tremendously between regions and communities, with historical events shaping local attitudes beyond these general patterns.

## Beyond the Core Species

While this compendium focuses on the four core species, many game worlds include additional options reflecting local conditions, parallel evolution, or magical influence. When integrating new species, consider:

**Physical Adaptations:** What environmental pressures shaped this species' development?

**Cultural Foundations:** How have their physical traits influenced their societies?

**Historical Context:** What significant events shaped their relationship with other species?

**Integration Method:** How does this species fit within existing communities and power structures?

The mechanical and narrative frameworks established for the core species provide templates for developing balanced and culturally rich additional options.

## Using This Compendium

The following sections provide detailed information about each of the four core species:

- **Physiological Traits:** The biological realities shaping capabilities and limitations
- **Cultural Patterns:** Common social structures, values, and practices
- **Historical Contexts:** Significant past events influencing modern attitudes
- **Regional Variations:** How different communities express species tendencies
- **Individual Expressions:** The range of variation within typical parameters
- **Character Concepts:** Sample character ideas highlighting species potential

This information serves as foundation for character creation and worldbuilding, providing context for your own creative development rather than rigid limitations. While certain biological facts remain consistent, cultural expressions vary widely between settings and communities, allowing flexible adaptation to different campaign concepts.
