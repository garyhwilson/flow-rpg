# Species

_Heritage, Physiology & Cultural Context_

## Introduction

In Autumn Phoenix, your character's Species represents one of the three foundational pillars of identity, alongside Archetype (professional training) and Calling (psychological motivation). Species shapes physical capabilities, cultural background, and perspective on the world. Unlike systems that treat species as purely mechanical packages, Autumn Phoenix approaches species as integrated combinations of physical traits, cultural contexts, and historical experiences.

## The Eight Species of Autumn Phoenix

| Species | Title | Core Identity |
| ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Human | The Adaptable Survivors | Diversity, ambition, rapid innovation |
| Elf | The Memory-Bound Mystics | Twilight Forest keepers, Resonance-attuned |
| Dwarf | The Stoneborn Builders | Ashcrest mountainfolk, master craftsmen |
| Felisari | The Feline Wanderers | Curious scouts, keepers of secrets |
| Cliffborn | The Mountain Scouts | Horned climbers, wind-bonded messengers |
| Emberkin | The Fire-Touched | Volcanic origin, Phoenix Cycle embodied |
| Umbrin | The Shadow Dreamers | Subterranean dreamkeepers, perfect memory |
| Arborian | The Season-Bound | Grove-born, seasonal aspect shifters |

## Design Philosophy

**Species enhance, not define.** Your choices matter more than your heritage. Species provides starting points rather than limitations—individual characters frequently develop against type.

**Balanced but distinct.** Each species offers unique advantages without power imbalances. No species is mechanically superior; each excels in different scenarios.

**Narrative-focused.** Traits support storytelling over mechanical optimization. Cultural tendencies inform roleplay without stereotyping.

**Simple mechanics.** Quick to understand and apply during play. Three to four traits per species, clearly defined.

**Flow-integrated.** Species traits interact with the Personal Momentum system, creating tactical choices during play.

## Species in Character Creation

Your choice of species influences:

- **Attribute Adjustments:** Natural tendencies toward certain physical and mental traits
- **Species Traits:** Unique capabilities differentiating each species (3-4 per species)
- **Cultural Context:** Starting perspective and values shaped by heritage
- **Lifespan:** Different relationships with time, commitment, and change

## Autumn Phoenix Themes

Each species reflects the world's core themes:

- **Phoenix Cycle:** Death and rebirth (especially Emberkin and Arborian)
- **Memory and Legacy:** Ancient knowledge preserved (Elf and Umbrin)
- **Adaptation:** Survival through change (Human and Felisari)
- **Elemental Connection:** Ties to stone, fire, shadow, and nature (Dwarf, Emberkin, Umbrin, Arborian)
- **Vertical Worlds:** Mountains and the spaces between (Cliffborn, Dwarf)

## Interspecies Relations

The eight species have complex relationships shaped by biological differences, historical interactions, and cultural values:

- **Humans** bridge gaps between species due to their adaptability and presence throughout Autumn Phoenix
- **Elves and Umbrin** share connections to memory and ancient knowledge, though their relationships with light differ
- **Dwarves and Cliffborn** share Ashcrest's mountains but occupy different vertical territories
- **Emberkin and Arborian** embody complementary aspects of the Phoenix Cycle—destruction and renewal
- **Felisari** integrate into other societies, trading secrets and serving as cultural bridges
