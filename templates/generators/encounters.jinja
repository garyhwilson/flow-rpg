## Captain Sera Blackthorn Hunts Heretics

Captain Sera Blackthorn leads the city's finest guards. She's hunting the party because they're accused of stealing a sacred relic. Driven by duty, she genuinely believes the PCs are guilty. Methodical and professional, she's reluctant to kill—preferring to capture them alive for trial.

**Her Squad:**
- **Sergeant Kain:** Her trusted second, follows orders without question
- **Marcus:** Young and eager, wants to prove himself
- **Jenna:** Veteran archer, has seen too much violence
- **Willem:** Grizzled veteran who questions the orders

**Stats:** Use veteran combatant baseline (Guard 20-24, Vitality 22-28). Add Professional Persuade and Insight to reflect her investigative role.

**Tactics:** Sera coordinates her squad to separate party members. She uses non-lethal techniques when possible. Willem might be convinced to stand down. Marcus can be goaded into mistakes.

**How This Plays:** The squad enables Sera's strategy through positioning. If Sera falls, Willem takes command but offers terms. If Willem and Sera both fall, the others scatter.

## The Red Cloak Gang Demands Tribute

Street thugs working for crime lord Vex. They're in it for money, not loyalty. Led by a tough named Scarface who keeps them in line through intimidation and the promise of easy coin.

**The Gang:**
- Most are barely-trained street muscle with clubs and knives
- Scarface is genuinely dangerous and knows it
- They'll flee if things turn badly—self-preservation beats loyalty

**Stats:**
- Gang members: Guard 10, Vitality 8, Damage 1d6+1, Professional Intimidate or Streetwise
- Scarface: Guard 13, Vitality 12, Damage 1d6+2, Professional Intimidate and Combat

*Street gangs typically have Guard 8-12 for regular members, with leaders slightly tougher at Guard 12-15.*

**Tactics:** Surround and threaten. Scarface hangs back and directs traffic. They want to scare, not die.

**Morale:** Scatter if Scarface falls or 3+ gang members drop. Can be bribed. Respect strength.

## Inquisitor Thrace and Her Templars

A zealous inquisitor who genuinely believes she's saving souls. Hunts heretics with holy magic and righteous fury. Methodical, offers mercy to those who recant. If defeated, she escapes to return as a recurring nemesis.

**Stats:**
- **Guard:** 48, **Vitality:** 84, **Damage:** 2d6+8
- **Skills:** Expert Theology and Insight, Professional Persuade
- **Momentum:** Starts at +2
- **Special:** 3 actions per round (MAXIMUM 2 attacks), DR 2, 3 legendary resistances

*Inquisitors with her experience typically have Guard 40-50 and Vitality 70-90.*

**Tactics:** Uses third action for holy techniques. Tries to convert PCs mid-combat. Calm and disappointed when they refuse redemption. Quotes scripture.

**Supporting Templars:** 4-6 faithful warriors who enable her positioning. They won't flee while she stands.

## Duelist Kain Moretti Defends His Employer

Hired sword protecting a noble. Has a code of honor—fights to first blood in duels, doesn't attack unconscious foes, accepts surrender. Prideful and can be goaded into single combat.

**Stats:**
- **Guard:** 22, **Vitality:** 30, **Damage:** 2d6+1
- **Skills:** Professional Combat and Insight
- **Momentum:** Starts at 0

*Skilled duelists typically have Guard 18-24 and Vitality 24-35.*

**Personality:** Honorable, expects respect, announces attacks dramatically.

**Weakness:** Can be talked into duels. Won't hurt bystanders. His honor is exploitable.

## The Necromancer's Laboratory

An ancient necromancer in his sanctum, surrounded by undead guardians and dark rituals. Environmental hazards everywhere. Multiple ways to win beyond straight combat.

**The Necromancer:**
- Fragile personally (low Vitality)
- Powerful magic (high Momentum, dangerous spells)
- Environmental control (can trigger hazards, seal doors)

**The Undead:**
- 10+ skeletal warriors
- Don't break morale, don't feel fear
- Controlled by necromancer—destroy him and they collapse

**The Environment:**
- Ritual circles that explode if disrupted
- Shelves of volatile reagents
- Trapped doors and windows
- Phylactery hidden somewhere (he can't truly die without destroying it)

**How This Plays:** Area effects devastate undead. Smart players target the necromancer. Creative players use the environment. The phylactery creates a second objective.

## Building Your Own Conflicts

Every adversary should be a character with a name, motivation, and personality. Their stats serve their story.

### Start With Who They Are

**Who are they?** Name, background, appearance
**What do they want?** Specific, immediate goal
**Why oppose the PCs?** Clear conflict of interest
**How do they fight?** Tactics informed by personality

### Add Supporting Details

**How do they react when hurt?** Fight harder? Flee? Offer terms?
**What are they willing to die for?** Most people prefer living
**Who do they care about?** Allies, family, ideology
**What do they fear?** Everyone fears something

### Assign Stats to Match

See the Adversary Creation Guide for baseline stats. These are starting points—adjust based on:

**Narrative Importance**
- Recurring villains need durability and escape options
- Minor threats can be frailer
- Climactic adversaries deserve higher stats

**Dramatic Needs**
- Chase scenes: fast movement, lower vitality (should escape)
- Social conflicts: high Presence/Mind, moderate combat
- Sieges: high vitality to survive prolonged fighting

**Story Logic**
- Ancient guardians survived centuries—high vitality makes sense
- Hired thugs flee when hurt—low loyalty matters more than stats
- Zealot cultists fight to death regardless of hit points

### Consider the Environment

The environment can be as important as the adversaries:

- Choke points make numbers less effective
- Cover protects vulnerable enemies
- Hazards create tactical complications
- Interactive elements reward creativity

## Adjusting During Play

If the conflict feels too easy:
- Reinforcements arrive (makes narrative sense)
- Enemy reveals hidden capability (was holding back)
- Environmental complication (alarm, collapse, hazard)
- Objective shifts (villain escapes with the prize)

If the conflict feels too hard:
- NPC ally arrives (someone who'd realistically help)
- Enemy offers terms (most people prefer living)
- Environmental opportunity (escape route, cover, weapon)
- Reveal a weakness (crack in armor, old injury, fear)

Make adjustments for story and drama, not mathematical balance.

*Give them names. Give them reasons. Let their personality show through their actions.*
