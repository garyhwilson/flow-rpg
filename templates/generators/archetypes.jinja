### Martial Archetypes

Three archetypes focus on non-magical combat:

**Fighter:**

- Combat Techniques chain together
- Starting edge (Weapon Focus or Tough)
- Medium armor, shield capable
- Pure martial excellence

**Ranger:**
- Survival-focused (Professional)
- Favored Terrain bonuses
- Starting edge (Fast Movement or Precise Strike)

**Rogue:**

- Gambits for risky plays
- No starting edge (compensated by extra Professional skill)
- Light armor, precision weapons
- Skill-based problem solver

### Starting Skill Analysis

**Professional (+2) Skills:**
- Your primary competency
- Very reliable (58% + 33% = 91% success on TN 8)
- Defines your core role

**Novice (-1) Skills:**
- Supporting capabilities
- Still useful (58% - 16.7% = 41% success on TN 8)
- Room to grow

**Untrained (not listed):**
- Can still attempt
- -2 penalty is significant but not impossible
- Invest milestones to improve

### Starting Edge Choices

**Fighter Edges:**
- **Weapon Focus:** Choose if you know your combat style (damage boost)
- **Tough:** Choose if you expect to tank (survival boost)

**Ranger Edges:**
- **Fast Movement:** Choose for mobility tactics (+1 zone of movement)
- **Precise Strike:** Choose for consistent damage (reroll one die per attack)

*Both choices are viable—pick based on playstyle preference.*

### Unique Subsystems

Each archetype has a special mechanic that sets it apart:

**Combat Techniques (Fighter):**
- Learn individual techniques at milestones
- Chain them together in combat
- Tactical depth through combinations

**Favored Terrain (Ranger):**
- Start with one terrain type
- Gain bonuses in that environment
- Expand to new terrains via milestones

**Divine Oath (Paladin):**
- Choose oath theme (work with GM)
- Oath provides powers and restrictions
- Evolves at major milestones

**Gambits (Rogue):**
- High-risk, high-reward actions
- Unlock through successful heists
- Narrative unlocks, not milestone-gated

**Metamagic (Wizard):**
- Modify spells with special techniques
- Heighten, quicken, widen, etc.
- Learn options at milestones

**Divine Domain (Cleric):**
- Deity grants specialized powers
- Domains like War, Knowledge, Life, etc.
- Powers expand at milestones

**Bardic Inspiration (Bard):**
- Grant allies bonus dice
- Die size increases with milestones
- Active support role

### Equipment Considerations

**Armor Choices:**
- **Heavy (Paladin):** DR 4, -2 Grace, -3 Sorcery
- **Medium (Fighter, Cleric):** DR 2, -1 Grace, -1 Sorcery
- **Light (Ranger, Rogue, Bard):** DR 1, no penalties
- **None (Wizard):** DR 0, +1 Sorcery, +1 movement

Your archetype determines starting armor, affecting:
- How much damage you can absorb
- Your Grace-based action penalties
- Your spellcasting penalties (if applicable)

**Starting Wealth:**
Varies by archetype (30-60 coins typically). This represents your initial purchasing power beyond starting equipment.

### Archetype and Calling Synergy

- **Fighter:** Champion, Guardian, Sentinel (martial protector themes)
- **Ranger:** Seeker, Scholar, Sentinel (wilderness wanderer themes)
- **Paladin:** Advocate, Guardian, Champion (righteous warrior themes)
- **Rogue:** Seeker, Enthusiast, Scholar (curious explorer themes)
- **Wizard:** Scholar, Seeker, Advocate (knowledge pursuer themes)
- **Cleric:** Guardian, Mediator, Advocate (care-giver themes)

## GM Guidelines for Archetypes

### Balancing Party Composition

**Ideal 4-Person Party:**
- 1 Frontline (Fighter, Paladin)
- 1 Damage/Utility (Ranger, Rogue, Wizard)
- 1 Support (Cleric, Bard)
- 1 Wildcard (any)

**But any composition works if:**
- Players understand their roles
- Everyone contributes to tactics
- GM adjusts challenges appropriately

### Unique Subsystems in Play

**Combat Techniques (Fighter):**
- Award new techniques as treasure/training
- Let players discover combinations
- Techniques should feel impactful

**Favored Terrain (Ranger):**
- Make terrain matter mechanically
- Bonus should be significant (typically +2 to relevant checks)
- Let ranger shine in their environments

**Divine Oath (Paladin):**
- Work with player to define oath restrictions
- Oath breaking should have consequences but not end character
- Oath powers should feel powerful

**Gambits (Rogue):**
- Reward creative heist plans with new gambits
- Gambits should have significant risk and reward
- Unlock through play, not just milestones

**Metamagic (Wizard):**
- Start with 1-2 options, gain more at milestones
- Costs should scale with spell tier
- Let wizard feel like master of magic

**Divine Domain (Cleric):**
- Domain defines cleric's specialty
- Domain powers supplement spells, not replace them
- Each domain should feel distinct

**Bardic Inspiration (Bard):**
- Start with d4, increase at milestones (d6, d8, d10, d12)
- Pool size scales with milestones
- Make bard feel like force multiplier

### Starting Equipment Customization

Players may request variations:
- Weapon swap within same category (longsword → mace)
- Armor downgrade (medium → light, keep difference in coins)
- Gear substitutions (equivalent value)

**General Rule:** Keep archetype identity but allow reasonable customization.

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I multiclass?**
A: No multiclassing. Use edges and milestones to add capabilities from other archetypes.

**Q: Can I change my archetype?**
A: Work with GM for narrative retraining. Rare but possible.

**Q: Why does Rogue start with two Professional skills?**
A: They don't get a starting edge. Two Professional skills compensates for this.

**Q: Can non-casters learn magic?**
A: Yes, if they meet attribute requirements (see Magic section). But they won't have Sorcery as Professional.
