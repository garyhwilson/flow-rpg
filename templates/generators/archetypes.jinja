# Character Archetypes

Your archetype represents your professional training—the skills, techniques, and capabilities that define your role in the party. Where your calling shapes who you are psychologically, your archetype determines what you can do practically.

Every archetype provides a complete starting package: combat-ready skills, specialized capabilities, professional equipment, and a unique subsystem that sets it apart from others. Whether you want to be an armored defender, a precise archer, a master of magic, or something else entirely, your archetype gives you the foundation to excel.

## {{ archetype.name }}

*{{ archetype.description }}*

### Professional Training

The {{ archetype.name }} begins with three skills honed through dedicated training:

{% for skill_name, skill_data in archetype.starting_skills.items() %}
**{{ skill_name.title() }}** - {{ skill_data.level.title() }} ({{ '+' if skill_data.modifier >= 0 else '' }}{{ skill_data.modifier }})
{% endfor %}

{% if archetype.special %}
{{ archetype.special }}
{% endif %}

This skill distribution reflects years of focused practice. Your Professional skill represents your core competency—the thing you've trained to do better than most. Your Novice skills show supporting capabilities that complement your primary focus.

{% if archetype.starting_edge %}
### Starting Specialization

Choose one edge that represents your specific combat training:

{% for edge_name, edge_effect in archetype.starting_edge.items() %}
{% if edge_name != 'choice' %}
**{{ edge_name.replace('_', ' ').title() }}** - {{ edge_effect }}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Both options work. Choose based on how you expect to fight, not which seems objectively better. Your preference shapes your character more than theoretical optimization.
{% endif %}

{% if archetype.spellcasting %}
### Magical Tradition

The {{ archetype.name }} channels magic through the {{ archetype.spellcasting.tradition }} tradition.

**Access:** {{ archetype.spellcasting.access }}

**Focus:** {{ archetype.spellcasting.focus }}

Unlike martial archetypes, you don't need to meet specific attribute requirements to cast spells. Your training gives you access to {{ archetype.spellcasting.tradition }} magic naturally, though higher attributes still make you more effective.
{% endif %}

### Starting Equipment

You begin your adventures properly equipped:

**Armor:** {{ archetype.starting_equipment.armor.title() }} armor
**Weapon:** {{ archetype.starting_equipment.weapon.title() }}
**Gear:** {{ archetype.starting_equipment.gear|join(', ') }}

This equipment represents the standard loadout for your profession. You can customize within reasonable bounds—swapping one weapon for another of similar type, choosing different gear of equivalent value—but your armor choice defines important tactical decisions about mobility, protection, and spellcasting capability.

### {{ archetype.unique_subsystem.name }}

{{ archetype.unique_subsystem.description }}

{{ archetype.unique_subsystem.progression }}

This subsystem defines what makes a {{ archetype.name }} distinct. While any character might learn some combat techniques or develop specialized skills, this mechanical framework belongs uniquely to your archetype.

### Common Psychological Patterns

{{ archetype.name }}s often embody certain callings more frequently than others: {{ archetype.natural_callings|join(', ')|title }}

These are tendencies, not restrictions. A {{ archetype.name }} can have any calling. But these patterns emerge naturally—the psychological drives that often lead people to choose this profession in the first place.

## Choosing Your Archetype

### Understanding Archetype Roles

Every archetype fills certain roles naturally:

**If you want to stand on the frontline and trade blows**, consider Fighter or Paladin. Both can wear substantial armor and survive focused enemy attention, though they approach combat differently.

**If you want to strike from range with precision and mobility**, consider Ranger or Rogue. Both excel at positioning and exploiting advantages, using agility over raw durability.

**If you want to reshape combat through magical power**, consider Wizard, Cleric, or Bard. Each offers different magical traditions and different approaches to spellcasting.

**If you want to blend martial capability with magical support**, consider Paladin or Bard. Both combine weapon skill with spellcasting, creating hybrid characters who adapt to varied challenges.

### The Four Spellcasting Archetypes

Four archetypes can cast spells, each approaching magic differently:

**Wizard** channels arcane magic through pure study and technique. You have the broadest spell selection and strongest direct damage, modified through metamagic to create precise effects. Most wizards avoid armor entirely, relying on Mage Armor and tactical positioning for defense.

**Cleric** channels divine magic granted by faith and devotion. You excel at healing and support, can wear medium armor without crippling your magic, and gain specialized powers through your chosen domain. You balance frontline presence with magical support.

**Bard** channels magic through performance and artistry. Your spells focus on utility and social situations rather than raw damage. You wear light armor comfortably, use Bardic Inspiration to multiply ally effectiveness, and serve as the party's versatile problem-solver.

**Paladin** channels divine magic through sacred oaths and conviction. You're the only heavy armor spellcaster, combining frontline durability with healing and smiting magic. Your spell selection is more limited, but your martial prowess compensates.

### The Three Martial Archetypes

Three archetypes focus entirely on physical capability without magical shortcuts:

**Fighter** represents pure martial excellence. You begin with Professional combat skill—better than any other archetype's combat ability. Your combat techniques chain together into devastating combinations, and your starting edge (Weapon Focus or Tough) shapes whether you emphasize damage or defense. You wear medium armor and can use shields, creating a versatile tactical package.

**Ranger** combines combat capability with wilderness expertise. Your Professional survival skill makes you invaluable outside combat, while your favored terrain bonus creates situations where you outperform everyone. You wear light armor for mobility, typically fight at range, and gain Fast Movement or Precise Strike to enhance your skirmishing style.

**Rogue** begins with two Professional skills—the only archetype with this advantage. Professional Stealth and Finesse make you exceptionally dangerous when circumstances favor precision over direct confrontation. You don't get a starting edge (your extra Professional skill compensates), but you develop gambits through play—high-risk, high-reward techniques earned through successful heists rather than standard advancement.

### Starting Skill Analysis

**Professional (+1) Skills** represent your core competency. At this level, you succeed 91% of the time at standard difficulty (TN 8). This is reliable expertise—the thing you do well enough to build a career around.

**Novice (-1) Skills** represent supporting capabilities. You succeed about 41% of the time at standard difficulty. Not reliable enough to stake everything on, but useful when combined with good tactics or favorable circumstances.

**Untrained Skills** carry a -2 penalty, reducing success to about 25% at standard difficulty. You can still attempt these actions, but you're gambling rather than applying expertise.

Through advances (earned via XP), you advance skills upward. Most characters reach Professional in multiple areas by mid-campaign (Seasoned/Veteran ranks) and push toward Expert (+2) in their primary focus.

### Starting Edge Decisions

Some archetypes choose a starting edge:

**Fighter** chooses between Weapon Focus (additional damage with chosen weapon type) or Tough (additional Guard). Weapon Focus suits aggressive damage dealers; Tough suits defenders who protect others. Neither choice is wrong—pick based on the fighter you want to play.

**Ranger** chooses between Fast Movement (+1 zone of movement per turn) or Precise Strike (reroll one damage die per attack). Fast Movement enables hit-and-run skirmishing; Precise Strike creates consistent damage output. Again, both work—choose your preferred style.

These choices don't lock you into permanent builds. They simply provide a starting direction that shapes your first few sessions.

### Equipment and Armor Considerations

Your starting armor profoundly affects how you play:

**Heavy Armor** (Paladin only) grants DR 4 but imposes -2 to Grace-based actions and -3 to Sorcery. You can absorb tremendous damage but move less gracefully and cast spells less effectively. Paladins accept this tradeoff because their build emphasizes durability and limited spellcasting.

**Medium Armor** (Fighter, Cleric) grants DR 2 with -1 to Grace and -1 to Sorcery. This balanced option lets you survive focused attacks while maintaining reasonable agility and decent spellcasting. Most balanced builds use medium armor.

**Light Armor** (Ranger, Rogue, Bard) grants DR 1 with no penalties. You trade protection for freedom of movement and full spellcasting capability. Light armor suits mobile combatants and primary spellcasters who can't afford the Sorcery penalty.

**No Armor** (Wizard) grants DR 0 but provides +1 to Sorcery and +1 zone of movement. Wizards typically use Mage Armor cantrip (grants +2 Guard) to compensate, creating a lightly defended but highly mobile and magically effective character.

Your archetype determines starting armor, but you can change armor types during play. A fighter might upgrade to heavy armor, a wizard might acquire enchanted robes, a ranger might switch to medium armor when dungeon-crawling. Starting armor establishes your baseline, not your permanent state.

### Archetype and Calling Synergy

Certain callings pair naturally with certain archetypes:

**Fighters** often embody Champion (protective strength), Guardian (helping through defense), or Sentinel (vigilant security). The martial protector archetype attracts these psychological patterns.

**Rangers** often embody Seeker (finding themselves in wilderness), Scholar (studying nature), or Sentinel (watching for danger). The wilderness wanderer attracts introspective, observant callings.

**Paladins** often embody Advocate (righteous truth), Guardian (selfless service), or Champion (strong protection). The divine warrior attracts conviction-driven callings.

**Rogues** often embody Seeker (discovering identity through adventure), Enthusiast (experiencing life), or Scholar (clever problem-solving). The cunning opportunist attracts curious, exploratory callings.

**Wizards** often embody Scholar (mastering knowledge), Seeker (understanding mysteries), or Advocate (pursuing truth). The arcane student attracts intellectual callings.

**Clerics** often embody Guardian (caring for others), Mediator (bringing peace), or Advocate (serving justice). The divine healer attracts nurturing, harmony-seeking callings.

**Bards** often embody Enthusiast (celebrating life), Mediator (connecting people), or Seeker (exploring experience). The performer attracts socially engaged, expressive callings.

But these are patterns, not rules. Against-type combinations create interesting character concepts:

- Advocate Rogue: A vigilante pursuing justice through unconventional means
- Champion Wizard: A competitive duel-focused mage who sees magic as strength
- Mediator Fighter: An enforcer who prevents violence through implied force
- Scholar Bard: A traveling academic who shares knowledge through performance

The system supports whatever concept you want to explore.

## Playing Your Archetype

### Understanding Your Unique Subsystem

Every archetype has a special mechanical framework:

**Combat Techniques (Fighter)** - You learn individual techniques by spending advances (earned through XP) and chain them together during fights. A technique might let you disarm an enemy, follow up with a precise strike, then intimidate nearby foes. The system rewards tactical thinking and creates combat depth beyond "I attack again."

**Favored Terrain (Ranger)** - You choose terrain types (urban, forest, mountain, etc.) and gain significant bonuses when operating in those environments. These aren't minor flavor bonuses—they're substantial mechanical advantages that make you exceptional in your element. Expand your terrain types by spending advances.

**Divine Oath (Paladin)** - Work with your GM to define your oath's restrictions and powers. Your oath might grant bonus damage against oath-breakers, protective auras for allies, or smiting capabilities against specific enemy types. Oath violations have consequences but shouldn't destroy your character—work with your GM to handle lapses and redemption.

**Gambits (Rogue)** - You don't learn gambits through standard advancement. Instead, you unlock them through successful heists and clever plans. Pull off an elaborate infiltration, and your GM might award a new gambit representing that technique. Gambits are high-risk, high-reward—spectacular successes when they work, dramatic failures when they don't.

**Metamagic (Wizard)** - You learn techniques that modify your spells. Heighten a spell to increase damage, quicken it to cast faster, widen it to affect more area. Each metamagic option costs additional Momentum, creating resource decisions. Start with 1-2 options, gain more by spending advances.

**Divine Domain (Cleric)** - Your deity grants specialized powers based on their domain (War, Knowledge, Life, Nature, etc.). Domain powers supplement your spells—a War domain cleric gains combat bonuses, a Knowledge domain cleric gains information-gathering capabilities. Domains expand as you gain advances.

**Bardic Inspiration (Bard)** - You grant allies bonus dice to add to their rolls. Start with d4s, upgrade to larger dice (d6, d8, d10, d12) as you advance through ranks. Your pool of inspiration dice grows with advancement. You multiply ally effectiveness rather than directly solving problems yourself.

### Tactical Considerations by Archetype

**Fighter** - Position yourself between enemies and squishier allies. Use your high Guard and armor to absorb attacks. Chain combat techniques to create cascading effects. Switch stances based on whether you're pushing forward (Aggressive) or holding ground (Defensive).

**Ranger** - Maintain distance from enemies. Use your mobility to create favorable positions. Fight in your favored terrain whenever possible—the bonuses are significant. Switch to melee if cornered, but your strength is avoiding that situation.

**Paladin** - Stand on the frontline and dare enemies to ignore you. Your heavy armor lets you survive focused fire. Use healing spells on allies in danger. Your smiting capabilities make you dangerous to specific enemy types—learn what your oath makes you good at killing.

**Rogue** - Avoid fair fights. Use stealth to create advantages. Position for flanking bonuses. Save gambits for moments when spectacular success changes everything. Your high skills make you valuable outside combat—take the lead in social and exploration challenges.

**Wizard** - Build Momentum with cantrips early in fights, then unleash powerful spells. Stay away from enemies—your low HP and armor make you fragile. Use metamagic to modify spells for specific situations. Your versatility is your strength; choose spells that cover different problem types.

**Cleric** - Balance healing allies with supporting through domain powers. Your medium armor lets you operate at medium range safely. Don't burn all your resources healing—sometimes dealing damage or controlling enemies prevents more damage than healing fixes.

**Bard** - Support allies with inspiration before combat gets serious. Use utility spells to create advantages. Your light armor and low HP make direct combat dangerous, but your social skills and magical versatility make you invaluable in varied situations.

## Game Master Guidance

### Balancing Party Composition

The ideal party has coverage:
- Someone who can take hits (Fighter, Paladin)
- Someone who deals consistent damage (any archetype can do this with right build)
- Someone who can heal or prevent damage (Cleric, Paladin, Bard)
- Someone who handles utility and problems (Rogue, Bard, Wizard, Ranger)

But any composition works if players understand their roles and work together. Four fighters can succeed through tactics and coordination. Four wizards can succeed through overwhelming magical versatility.

Don't force players to choose archetypes for party balance. Encourage them to play what interests them, then adjust encounters to their composition.

### Supporting Unique Subsystems

**Combat Techniques (Fighter)** - Award new techniques as treasure or training rewards. Let players discover combinations through experimentation. When a fighter chains three techniques into a devastating combo, make it feel impactful.

**Favored Terrain (Ranger)** - Make terrain matter. Don't just describe the forest, create mechanical situations where forest knowledge provides advantages. Rangers should feel exceptional in their terrain, not merely slightly better.

**Divine Oath (Paladin)** - Work with the player to define oath tenets. Violating the oath should have consequences (temporary loss of powers, need for atonement) but shouldn't end the character. Redemption arcs are dramatic and engaging.

**Gambits (Rogue)** - Reward clever heist planning with new gambit options. Gambits should feel risky—high reward when they succeed, dramatic failure when they don't. Don't make every gambit succeed; the risk is part of the appeal.

**Metamagic (Wizard)** - Let wizards feel like masters of magic. Metamagic should enable tricks other casters can't pull off. The Momentum cost creates meaningful decisions about when to use standard spells versus enhanced versions.

**Divine Domain (Cleric)** - Make domains feel distinct. A War cleric should feel different from a Knowledge cleric both mechanically and narratively. Domain powers should be significant enough to matter without overshadowing spellcasting.

**Bardic Inspiration (Bard)** - Let inspiration dice turn failures into successes. When a bard gives inspiration and it changes the outcome, highlight that moment. Bards should feel like they make everyone better.

### Starting Equipment Customization

Players sometimes want to modify starting equipment:

**Weapon Swaps** - Allow swaps within the same category. A fighter starting with a longsword can swap for a mace or battleaxe. Don't allow radical changes (longsword to bow) without narrative justification.

**Armor Downgrades** - Players can choose lighter armor and keep the cost difference in coins. A fighter might start with light armor instead of medium, gaining coins for other purchases.

**Gear Substitutions** - Allow equivalent-value gear swaps. If starting gear includes rope and pitons, a player might swap for a grappling hook and oil.

General principle: Maintain the archetype's intended capability while allowing reasonable personalization.

### Common Questions

**Can characters multiclass?**
No. Autumn Phoenix RPG doesn't use multiclassing. Instead, use specialties and advance options to add capabilities from other archetypes. A fighter who wants magical ability can learn basic spellcasting at higher ranks (Heroic+) if their attributes support it.

**Can characters retrain or change archetypes?**
Rarely, with strong narrative justification. A wizard who abandons magic to become a fighter would need significant story development. Work with players who want radical changes, but treat it as a major character arc, not a casual respec.

**Why does Rogue start with two Professional skills but no edge?**
Balance. Two Professional skills is roughly equivalent in power to one Professional skill plus a starting edge. Rogues trade the immediate capability of an edge for broader skill competency.

**Can non-spellcasters learn magic later?**
Yes, if they meet attribute requirements. A fighter with high Mind could learn some spells at higher ranks (Heroic+). They won't cast as effectively as Wizard (no Professional Sorcery), but basic magic is accessible to anyone who studies and has the mental capability.
