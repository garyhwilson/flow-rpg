# Character Advancement

Your character grows through experience, earning XP each session that accumulates into Advances. This Savage Worlds-inspired system creates predictable, satisfying progression over 30-50 session campaigns.

## The XP and Ranks System

Autumn Phoenix RPG uses a simple advancement structure:

- **GM awards 3-5 XP per session** (average 4)
- **5 XP = 1 Advance**
- **4 Advances = 1 Rank promotion**
- **5 Ranks total:** Novice → Seasoned → Veteran → Heroic → Legendary

---

# The Five Ranks

Your Rank represents your overall experience and power level. As you accumulate advances, you'll promote through the ranks.

| Rank | Advances Required | Typical Sessions |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Novice** | 0-3 advances | Sessions 1-8 |
| **Seasoned** | 4-7 advances | Sessions 9-16 |
| **Veteran** | 8-11 advances | Sessions 17-24 |
| **Heroic** | 12-15 advances | Sessions 25-32 |
| **Legendary** | 16+ advances | Sessions 33+ |

## Rank Descriptions

**Novice (0-3 Advances)**
New adventurers finding their footing. You're competent but still learning. Local threats like bandits and wild animals are appropriate challenges.

**Seasoned (4-7 Advances)**
Established heroes with growing reputations. You've proven yourself and are known in the region. Organized crime, cultists, and dangerous beasts are your foes.

**Veteran (8-11 Advances)**
Renowned champions at the peak of mortal capability. You've likely reached the +5 modifier cap in your primary skills. Noble houses, young dragons, and demon cults challenge you.

**Heroic (12-15 Advances)**
Legendary figures whose names are known across the land. You grow through versatility now, not raw power. Ancient guardians and planar threats test your might.

**Legendary (16+ Advances)**
Mythic heroes challenging gods and fate itself. You're among the most powerful beings in existence. Demon lords, ancient dragons, and world-ending catastrophes await.

# The Advance Menu

Each time you gain an advance (every 5 XP), choose ONE option from this menu:

## Raise a Skill

Increase one skill by one tier:
- Untrained (-2) → Novice (-1)
- Novice (-1) → Competent (+0)
- Competent (+0) → Professional (+1)
- Professional (+1) → Expert (+2)

**Cost:** 1 advance (or 2 advances if raising above your linked attribute)

## New Skill

Gain a new skill at Novice tier (-1).

## New Specialty

Gain a combat, skill, or social specialty. See the Specialties section for available options.

## Raise Attribute

Increase one attribute by +1.

**Important Limit:** You can only raise an attribute **once per Rank**. This prevents rushing to the +5 modifier cap.

- Maximum attribute: +3
- Choose wisely—you only get one attribute increase per rank!

## New Technique

Gain a combat technique, metamagic option, or special ability. Some techniques have **Rank Requirements** (see Techniques section).

## Increase Survivability

Choose one:
- +2 Guard (your defensive threshold)
- +2 Vitality (your health pool)

---

# Specialties

Specialties provide focused bonuses and unique capabilities. They're organized into categories for convenience, but any character can take any specialty.

## Combat Specialties

| Specialty | Benefit | Limit |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Weapon Focus** | +1 damage with one weapon type | Once per weapon type |
| **Armor Training** | Reduce armor penalty by 1 | Once per armor type |
| **Tough** | +2 Guard | Twice |
| **Hardy** | +2 Vitality | Twice |
| **Quick Draw** | Switch weapons as free action | Once |
| **Combat Reflexes** | +1 to defense rolls | Once |
| **Fast Movement** | +1 zone of movement per turn | Once |
| **Precise Strike** | Reroll one damage die per attack | Once |
| **Defensive Fighter** | +1 Guard in Defensive stance | Once |

## Skill Specialties

| Specialty | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Expert Knowledge** | +1 to specific skill application |
| **Signature Technique** | Create a unique skill use |
| **Tool Mastery** | No penalty without proper tools |

## Momentum Specialties

| Specialty | Benefit | Limit |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Momentum Harmony** | +1 maximum Momentum capacity | Three times |
| **Efficient Techniques** | -1 Momentum cost to one technique | Once per technique |
| **Quick Recovery** | +1 Momentum at start of combat | Once |

# Techniques

Techniques are powerful abilities that typically cost Momentum to use. Some require a minimum Rank.

## Combat Techniques (Novice)

Available to all characters:

- **Press Advantage:** When Momentum is positive, +1d6 damage
- **Defensive Strike:** Attack and gain +2 Guard until next turn
- **Momentum Strike:** On hit, gain +1 Momentum

## Advanced Combat Techniques (Requires Seasoned)

- **Whirlwind Strike:** Hit all adjacent enemies (costs 2 Momentum)
- **Perfect Parry:** Negate all damage from one source (costs 2 Momentum)
- **Devastating Blow:** Double damage dice (costs 3 Momentum)

## Legendary Techniques (Requires Heroic)

- **Unstoppable Assault:** Attack cannot miss (costs 4 Momentum)
- **Avatar of War:** Temporary transformation with massive bonuses (costs 5 Momentum)
- **Death Defiance:** Return from death's door (costs 6 Momentum)

## Mythic Techniques (Requires Legendary)

- **Reality Warp:** Alter the battlefield itself
- **Timeless Strike:** Act outside the normal turn order

# Bounded Accuracy

Autumn Phoenix uses bounded accuracy—your total modifier is capped at +5.

## The Math

- **Maximum attribute:** +3
- **Maximum skill:** +2 (Expert)
- **Maximum specialty bonus:** Varies, but total capped at +5

## When You Hit the Cap

Most characters reach the +5 cap in their primary skills during the **Veteran rank** (sessions 17-24). After that:

- **Horizontal growth:** Gain new specialties, techniques, and abilities
- **Versatility:** Improve other skills and secondary attributes
- **Survivability:** Increase Guard and Vitality
- **Options:** Learn new techniques and metamagic

You won't get more powerful at your best skills, but you'll become more versatile and survivable.

# Building Your Character Through Advances

## The Philosophy of Choice

Every advance presents a choice. Do you specialize further in what you already do well, or do you diversify to handle new challenges? Both approaches work—the decision itself is what makes your character unique.

**Specialization** creates focused expertise. A character who invests repeatedly in combat specialties becomes exceptionally dangerous in fights, but may struggle with social challenges or magical problems.

**Diversification** creates versatility. A character who spreads advances across skills, attributes, and varied specialties can handle many situations, but won't dominate any single area.

Most successful characters blend both approaches—specializing in their core competency while diversifying enough to contribute meaningfully to varied situations.

## Strategy by Rank

**Novice (Sessions 1-8):**
- Build toward your +5 cap in primary skill
- Take specialties that support your core role
- Consider attribute boosts strategically (once per rank!)

**Seasoned (Sessions 9-16):**
- Push primary skills toward Expert (+2)
- Unlock Seasoned-rank techniques
- Begin diversifying into secondary skills

**Veteran (Sessions 17-24):**
- Reach your +5 modifier cap
- Focus on horizontal growth: new techniques, versatility
- Increase survivability (Guard, Vitality)

**Heroic (Sessions 25-32):**
- Master multiple combat and skill approaches
- Learn Heroic-rank techniques
- Become truly legendary

**Legendary (Sessions 33+):**
- Access Mythic techniques
- Transcend normal limitations
- Shape the world around you

# For Game Masters

## Awarding XP

Award XP at the end of every session:

| Session Quality | XP Award |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Routine** | 3 XP |
| **Good progress** | 4 XP |
| **Exceptional** | 5 XP |

**Guidelines:**
- Always give at least 3 XP for showing up
- Award whole-party XP (no individual awards)
- Tell players why they earned bonus XP

## Scaling Challenges by Rank

As characters advance, increase challenge difficulty:

| Party Rank | Standard TN | Hard TN |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Novice | TN 8 | TN 10 |
| Seasoned | TN 10 | TN 12 |
| Veteran | TN 10 | TN 12 |
| Heroic | TN 12 | TN 14 |
| Legendary | TN 12 | TN 14 |

## Rank Promotions

When players reach a new rank:
- Acknowledge it in the fiction
- Consider a scene celebrating their growing reputation
- Unlock rank-appropriate challenges and storylines
- Introduce NPCs who recognize their status

## Handling Advance Choices

When players earn advances, give them time to consider options. Some players know immediately what they want; others need to review possibilities.

**Between Sessions:** Award XP at session end, let players make advance choices before next session.

**During Sessions:** If needed for narrative timing, allow quick choices or suggest simple options.

**Analysis Paralysis:** If a player struggles to choose, suggest two good options and explain why both work.
