# Character Advancement

Your character grows through meaningful achievements, not abstract experience points. Every few sessions, when the story reaches a natural pause or the party accomplishes something significant, you reach a milestone and gain new capabilities.

Flow RPG uses three tiers of milestones, each marking different levels of growth:

**Minor Milestones** - {{ milestone_data.minor_milestones.frequency }}. Small but meaningful improvements that accumulate over time.

**Moderate Milestones** - {{ milestone_data.moderate_milestones.frequency }}. Significant power increases that change how you play.

**Major Milestones** - {{ milestone_data.major_milestones.frequency }}. Transformative moments that define your character's legend.

# Minor Milestones

{{ milestone_data.minor_milestones.philosophy }}

These frequent advancement opportunities let you refine your capabilities between sessions. Over time, small choices accumulate into a character that's uniquely yours.

## When You Reach Minor Milestones

Minor milestones occur when:

{% for trigger in milestone_data.minor_milestones.triggers %}
- {{ trigger }}
{% endfor %}

Your GM determines exact timing based on campaign pacing, but expect one every 1-2 sessions on average.

## Your Advancement Options

When you reach a minor milestone, choose one of the following options:

{% for option_key, option_data in milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.items() %}
{% if option_data is mapping %}

### {{ option_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if option_data.description %}
{{ option_data.description }}

{% endif %}
{% if option_key == 'edge' %}
Rather than broad capability increases, edges represent focused expertise in specific areas. See the Edges chapter for available options and detailed descriptions.

When choosing an edge, consider what situations you face regularly. Edges shine in their specialty but don't replace general capability.
{% elif option_key == 'skill_advancement' %}
You can improve one skill by one tier. This makes you more reliable in that area across all situations.

**Advancement Path:** Untrained (-2) → Novice (-1) → Competent (0) → Professional (+1) → Expert (+2) → Master (+3)

Most characters reach Professional in their primary skills by mid-campaign. Expert and Master represent exceptional expertise typically achieved through dedicated focus.
{% elif option_key == 'attribute_boost' %}
You can increase one attribute by 1 point. This affects all actions using that attribute, making it a broadly applicable choice.

**Typical Progression:** Most characters start with attributes between -1 and +2. Through milestones and major growth, attributes can reach +4 or higher in exceptional cases.

Consider boosting attributes that support multiple skills you use frequently, or shore up weaknesses that limit your effectiveness.

# Moderate Milestones

{{ milestone_data.moderate_milestones.philosophy }}

These milestones represent noticeable power increases. Where minor milestones accumulate gradually, moderate milestones create immediate, visible improvements to your character.

## When You Reach Moderate Milestones

Moderate milestones occur when:

{% for trigger in milestone_data.moderate_milestones.triggers %}
- {{ trigger }}
{% endfor %}

## Typical Campaign Schedule

{% if milestone_data.moderate_milestones.schedule %}
In a standard 8-12 session campaign, moderate milestones typically occur:

{% for key, schedule in milestone_data.moderate_milestones.schedule.items() %}
{% if key != 'design_note' and schedule is mapping %}
**{{ schedule.timing }}** - {{ schedule.context }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Your campaign's exact schedule may vary based on story pacing and session frequency.
{% endif %}

## Your Advancement Options

When you reach a moderate milestone, choose one of the following options:

{% for option_key, option_data in milestone_data.moderate_milestones.options.items() %}
{% if option_data is mapping %}

### {{ option_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if option_data.description %}
{{ option_data.description }}

{% endif %}
{% if option_data.choose_one %}
Choose one of the following:

{% for choice_key, choice_data in option_data.choose_one.items() %}
{% if choice_key != 'description' and choice_data is mapping %}
**{{ choice_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}** - {{ choice_data.description if choice_data.description else choice_data }}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

# Major Milestones

{{ milestone_data.major_milestones.philosophy }}

Major milestones mark transformative moments in your character's story. These aren't just mechanical upgrades—they represent fundamental changes in who your character is and what they're capable of.

## When You Reach Major Milestones

Major milestones occur when:

{% for trigger in milestone_data.major_milestones.triggers %}
- {{ trigger }}
{% endfor %}

## Typical Campaign Schedule

{% if milestone_data.major_milestones.schedule %}
In a standard campaign, major milestones mark key story beats:

{% for key, schedule in milestone_data.major_milestones.schedule.items() %}
{% if key != 'design_note' and schedule is mapping %}
**{{ schedule.timing }}** - {{ schedule.context }}
{% if schedule.significance %}

*{{ schedule.significance }}*
{% endif %}
{% if schedule.note %}

*({{ schedule.note }})*
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Advancement Options

When you reach a major milestone, choose one of the following options. These represent legendary capabilities that set you apart as a hero of note:

{% for option_key, option_data in milestone_data.major_milestones.options.items() %}
{% if option_data is mapping %}

### {{ option_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if option_data.description %}
{{ option_data.description }}

{% endif %}
{% if option_data.choose_one %}
Choose one of the following:

{% for choice_key, choice_data in option_data.choose_one.items() %}
{% if choice_key != 'description' and choice_data is mapping %}
**{{ choice_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}** - {{ choice_data.description if choice_data.description else choice_data }}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Building Your Character Through Milestones

### The Philosophy of Choice

Every milestone presents a choice. Do you specialize further in what you already do well, or do you diversify to handle new challenges? Both approaches work—the decision itself is what makes your character unique.

**Specialization** creates focused expertise. A character who invests repeatedly in combat edges becomes exceptionally dangerous in fights, but may struggle with social challenges or magical problems.

**Diversification** creates versatility. A character who spreads advancements across skills, attributes, and varied edges can handle many situations, but won't dominate any single area.

Most successful characters blend both approaches—specializing in their core competency while diversifying enough to contribute meaningfully to varied situations.

### Minor Milestone Strategy

You'll have many minor milestones throughout a campaign. Early choices often focus on shoring up weaknesses or rounding out your starting concept. Later choices tend toward specialization in areas where you've already demonstrated strength.

**Early Campaign (Sessions 1-3):**
- Advance your secondary skills to Competent or Professional
- Take edges that support your core role
- Consider attribute boosts to important secondary attributes

**Mid Campaign (Sessions 4-8):**
- Push primary skills toward Expert
- Specialize with edges that create unique capabilities
- Boost primary attributes to maximize reliability

**Late Campaign (Sessions 9+):**
- Master-tier skills in your specialty
- Edges that create signature moves
- Final attribute optimization

### Moderate Milestone Strategy

Moderate milestones offer powerful, often build-defining options. These choices should feel significant and memorable.

**Signature Moves** create dramatic moments that define your character in combat. The move that everyone at the table associates with your character often comes from a moderate milestone.

**Advanced Techniques** represent refined mastery of your archetype's unique subsystem. Fighters gain new combat techniques, wizards learn metamagic, rogues develop gambits.

**Power Increases** provide immediate combat effectiveness through better damage, defense, or resource economy. These feel less thematic but noticeably improve your power level.

Choose based on what creates interesting moments at the table, not just optimal numbers.

### Major Milestone Strategy

Major milestones are rare and transformative. These choices should reflect your character's growth arc and the story you've told together.

**Legendary Abilities** grant capabilities that transcend normal human limits. These are the abilities that make you a legend, not just an adventurer.

**Attribute Mastery** pushes attributes beyond normal ranges, representing fundamental transformation in who you are.

**Paradigm Shifts** might include learning entirely new subsystems, gaining access to magic you previously couldn't use, or fundamentally changing your role in the party.

Consider the narrative impact as much as the mechanical benefit. What does this choice say about who your character has become?

## Game Master Guidance

### Awarding Milestones

The guidelines above provide typical pacing, but your campaign may differ. Some campaigns compress into 6 intense sessions, others sprawl across 20+ sessions. Adjust milestone frequency to match your story.

**Award minor milestones based on:**
- Session count (every 1-2 sessions as a baseline)
- Story beats (completing an investigation, winning a battle)
- Player engagement (when advancement would maintain interest)

**Award moderate milestones based on:**
- Story arc completion (defeating the bandit king, uncovering the conspiracy)
- Major victories (surviving the deadly dungeon, winning the tournament)
- Campaign phase transitions (moving from act one to act two)

**Award major milestones based on:**
- Campaign climaxes (confronting the main villain, saving the kingdom)
- Fundamental story shifts (character revelations, world-changing events)
- Transformative character moments (overcoming core flaws, achieving major goals)

### Handling Milestone Choices

When players reach milestones, give them time to consider options. Some players know immediately what they want; others need to review possibilities or discuss with the table.

**Between Sessions:** Award milestones at session end, let players choose before next session. This prevents advancement from consuming play time.

**During Sessions:** If you award mid-session (dramatic moment calls for immediate growth), allow quick choices or default to simple options (skill advancement, attribute boost).

**Analysis Paralysis:** If a player struggles to choose, suggest two good options and explain why both work. The choice itself matters less than moving forward.

### Milestone Timing Variance

Not all campaigns follow standard pacing:

**Short Campaigns (4-6 sessions):**
- Award minor milestones every session
- Award moderate milestones at sessions 2, 4
- Award major milestone at campaign climax (session 5-6)

**Long Campaigns (15+ sessions):**
- Maintain minor milestone every 1-2 sessions
- Spread moderate milestones every 3-4 sessions
- Award major milestones at major story arcs (sessions 5, 10, 15, etc.)

**Episodic Campaigns:**
- Award minor milestone after each episode
- Award moderate milestone after multi-episode arcs
- Award major milestone at season finales

The system is flexible. Adjust to your table's needs.

### Encouraging Meaningful Choices

Some players optimize mechanically. Others choose thematically. Both approaches are valid.

**For optimizers:** Help them understand how different choices achieve their goals. Is +1 to Combat better than a combat edge? Depends on application.

**For thematic choosers:** Ensure their thematic choices remain mechanically viable. A character built purely for theme shouldn't struggle to contribute.

**For variety:** Encourage players to try different advancement types. A player who only takes edges misses the satisfaction of watching their core skills improve. A player who only boosts attributes might feel less distinctive than one who takes edges.

*Advancement in Flow RPG isn't about becoming generically more powerful—it's about becoming more uniquely yourself.*
