# ARMOR SYSTEM - MECHANICAL REFERENCE
*Generated from YAML source data*

## Overview

Armor provides damage reduction (DR) but comes with trade-offs. Each armor category offers distinct tactical benefits and penalties, creating meaningful choices for different character builds.

**Key Principle:** Armor reduces incoming damage but affects your capabilities in different ways.

{% for armor_id, armor_data in armor_types.items() %}
## {{ armor_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

### Defense
- **Damage Reduction:** {{ armor_data.damage_reduction }} (reduces all incoming damage)
{% if armor_data.description %}
- **Description:** {{ armor_data.description }}
{% endif %}

### Penalties
{% if armor_data.penalties %}
{% if armor_data.penalties.grace and armor_data.penalties.grace != 0 %}
- **Grace Penalty:** {{ armor_data.penalties.grace }} to all Grace-based actions
{% endif %}
{% if armor_data.penalties.spellcasting and armor_data.penalties.spellcasting != 0 %}
- **Spellcasting Penalty:** {{ armor_data.penalties.spellcasting }} to Sorcery checks
{% endif %}
{% if armor_data.penalties.flow and armor_data.penalties.flow != "None" %}
- **Flow Penalty:** {{ armor_data.penalties.flow }}
{% endif %}
{% if armor_data.penalties.grace == 0 and armor_data.penalties.flow == "None" %}
- **No Penalties** - This armor category has no mechanical penalties
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

### Benefits
{% if armor_data.benefits %}
{% for benefit_key, benefit_value in armor_data.benefits.items() %}
- **{{ benefit_key.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ benefit_value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

### Cost
- **Price Range:** {{ armor_data.cost }}

{% if armor_data.examples %}
### Examples
{% for example_name, example_data in armor_data.examples.items() %}
#### {{ example_name.replace('_', ' ').title() }}
- **DR:** {{ example_data.dr }}
{% if example_data.special %}
- **Special:** {{ example_data.special }}
{% endif %}
- **Cost:** {{ example_data.cost }} coins
{% endfor %}

## Choosing Armor

### By Character Type

**Unarmored Characters (No Armor):**
- Best for: Monks, mobile rogues, evasion-focused characters, spellcasters
- Strategy: Maximum mobility, Flow generation, and spellcasting
- Trade-off: Rely on Guard and positioning instead of DR

**Light Armor Characters:**
- Best for: Rangers, rogues, duelists, light combatants, most spellcasters
- Strategy: Balance protection with mobility and flexibility
- Trade-off: Modest DR for maintained capabilities

**Medium Armor Characters:**
- Best for: Fighters, clerics, versatile combatants
- Strategy: Solid protection with manageable penalties
- Trade-off: Grace penalty affects finesse actions, minor spellcasting impact

**Heavy Armor Characters:**
- Best for: Paladins, defenders, front-line fighters
- Strategy: Maximum protection, become immovable bastion
- Trade-off: Significant penalties to Grace, Flow generation, and spellcasting

### Armor and Stances

**Aggressive Stance:**
- Light/No Armor: Act first, high mobility, generate Flow quickly
- Medium Armor: Balanced approach, reliable damage
- Heavy Armor: Slower but devastating when you connect

**Balanced Stance:**
- Light/No Armor: Flexibility to react, easy stance switching
- Medium Armor: The intended use case, no restrictions
- Heavy Armor: Solid but less flexible

**Defensive Stance:**
- Light/No Armor: +2 Guard, generate Flow while protected
- Medium Armor: +3 Guard total (armor +1, stance +2)
- Heavy Armor: +6 Guard total (armor +4, stance +2) - nearly untouchable

## Armor Progression

Characters typically upgrade armor as they:
1. **Gain wealth** - Better quality examples within same category
2. **Increase attributes** - Offset penalties with higher stats
3. **Acquire magical armor** - Same category, enhanced benefits
4. **Change tactics** - Switch categories as playstyle evolves

Most characters find their preferred armor category early and improve within it rather than constantly moving between categories.

## GM Guidelines

### Creating Appropriate Challenges
- Remember DR reduces **all** incoming damage
- Heavy armor characters have high DR but generate less Flow
- Challenge high-DR characters with:
  - Multiple small attacks (DR applies per hit)
  - Effects that bypass DR (forced movement, conditions)
  - Armor-piercing abilities (specific adversaries/weapons)

### Treasure and Rewards
- Quality matters more than category
- Enhanced versions within same category (magical +1 DR, special properties)
- Armor as character expression (decorative, cultural significance)
- Don't push characters to "upgrade" if they like their current category

### Common Mistakes
- Don't forget armor penalties apply constantly (not just in combat)
- Heavy armor's Flow penalty affects **all** Flow generation
- Grace penalties affect Athletics, Stealth, Finesse-based actions
- No armor bonuses only apply when truly unarmored (not with shields)

*Armor is more than protection—it's a fundamental tactical choice that shapes how your character approaches every situation.*
