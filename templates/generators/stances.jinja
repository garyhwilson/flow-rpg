# COMBAT STANCES - TACTICAL REFERENCE
*Generated from YAML source data*

## Overview

Every combatant chooses a stance at the start of combat, determining their tactical approach. Stances affect turn order, Flow generation, combat modifiers, and special abilities.

**Stance Selection:** Choose at combat start, can switch on your turn (costs Flow)

{% if generation is mapping %}
**{{ generation_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:**
- Trigger: {{ generation.trigger }}
- Amount: +{{ generation.amount }} Flow
{% if generation.limit %}
- Limit: {{ generation.limit }}
{% endif %}

## Stance Tactics

### When to Use Each Stance

**Aggressive Stance:**
- High damage output characters
- When you need to end combat quickly
- First strike advantage is critical
- Building Flow through successful attacks
- Charging builds (mobile melee)

**Balanced Stance:**
- Uncertain combat situations
- When you need tactical flexibility
- Critical-focused builds
- Free stance switching per combat
- Versatile party roles

**Defensive Stance:**
- Tanks and protectors
- Spellcasters building Flow safely
- When outnumbered
- Protecting vulnerable allies
- Flow generation engine

### Stance Switching

**Cost:** Switching stance costs Flow based on direction:
- Aggressive → Balanced: 0 Flow
- Balanced → Aggressive/Defensive: 0 Flow (Tactical Flexibility once per combat)
- Defensive → Balanced: 0 Flow (Dwarf racial, otherwise 1 Flow)
- Any other switch: 1 Flow

**Timing:** Switch on your turn before taking actions

**Strategy:** Start in one stance, switch based on combat developments

### Flow Generation Comparison

**Aggressive:** 1-3 Flow per round (attacks hit, charge bonus, critical overwhelm)
**Balanced:** 1-2 Flow per round (critical successes)
**Defensive:** 1-3 Flow per round (being attacked, successful defenses)

All three stances generate comparable Flow over combat, but through different triggers.

### Stance and Archetype Synergy

**Fighter:** Any stance works
- Aggressive for pure damage
- Balanced for technique combos
- Defensive for tanking

**Ranger:** Primarily Aggressive or Balanced
- Aggressive for skirmishing
- Balanced for tactical shooting
- Defensive less common (mobility focus)

**Paladin:** Defensive or Balanced
- Defensive while protecting allies
- Balanced for flexibility
- Can use Aggressive with heavy armor (-1 Flow generation)

**Rogue:** Aggressive or Balanced
- Aggressive for burst damage
- Balanced for adaptability
- Defensive rare (low armor)

**Wizard/Cleric/Bard:** Defensive or Balanced
- Defensive to build Flow safely
- Balanced when confident
- Aggressive rare (low HP/armor)

### Stance Combinations in Party

**Balanced Party (4 players):**
- 1 Defensive (tank)
- 2 Aggressive (damage dealers)
- 1 Balanced (support/utility)

**All Stances Work:**
- 4 Aggressive = glass cannon party
- 4 Defensive = grinding attrition
- 4 Balanced = tactical flexibility
- Mixed = recommended for variety

### Advanced Stance Tactics

**Stance Dancing:**
- Start Defensive (build Flow)
- Switch to Aggressive (spend Flow)
- Switch to Balanced (reassess)

**Role Swapping:**
- Fighter starts Aggressive
- Takes heavy damage
- Switches to Defensive to recover
- Back to Aggressive when healed

**Coordination:**
- Defensive player protects casters
- Aggressive players focus fire
- Balanced players respond to threats

## GM Guidelines for Stances

### Running Stances

**Initiative Order:**
1. Aggressive stance characters
2. Balanced stance characters
3. Defensive stance characters
4. Within each group, highest relevant attribute

**Don't forget:**
- Stance modifiers apply to all rolls
- Flow generation happens when triggered
- Stance switching costs Flow (usually)
- Special abilities are always available

### Encouraging Tactical Play

**Vary encounters:**
- Single boss favors Aggressive
- Multiple enemies favor Defensive
- Mixed encounters favor Balanced

**Reward stance switching:**
- Battles that change mid-fight
- Environmental shifts
- Reinforcements arriving

**Track Flow visibly:**
- Let players see stance choices working
- Make Flow generation feel meaningful
- Celebrate high Flow moments

### Common Mistakes

**Players forget:**
- Aggressive movement requirement (toward nearest enemy)
- Defensive bonus is +2, not +1
- Balanced free switch is once per combat
- Aggressive critical bonus Flow

**GMs forget:**
- Turn order by stance
- Flow generation triggers
- Special ability availability
- Stance modifiers to damage/defense
