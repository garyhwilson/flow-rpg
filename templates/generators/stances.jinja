# Combat Stances

At the start of every fight, you make a fundamental decision: how will you approach this conflict? Your stance represents your combat philosophy—whether you press forward aggressively, hold back defensively, or adapt moment by moment to changing circumstances.

Stances aren't just flavor. They determine when you act in the turn order, how you generate Momentum, what bonuses and penalties you face, and what special capabilities you can access. Mastering all three stances and knowing when to switch between them is the mark of a skilled combatant.

{% for stance_id, stance in stances.items() %}

## {{ stance.name }} Stance

*"{{ stance.philosophy }}"*

### Initiative

You act **{{ 'first' if stance.turn_order == 1 else ('second' if stance.turn_order == 2 else 'last') }}** in the turn order. {% if stance.turn_order == 1 %}All Aggressive combatants move before anyone in other stances. If multiple combatants choose Aggressive, they act in order of highest Awareness (or Might if tied).{% elif stance.turn_order == 2 %}You act after Aggressive combatants but before Defensive ones. If multiple combatants choose Balanced, they act in order of highest Mind (or Will if tied).{% else %}You act last in the turn order. All Aggressive and Balanced combatants move before you. If multiple combatants choose Defensive, they act in order of highest Will (or Presence if tied).{% endif %}

### Momentum Generation

{% if stance.momentum_generation %}
You generate Momentum through the following triggers:

{% for generation_id, generation in stance.momentum_generation.items() %}
{% if generation is mapping %}
**{{ generation_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}**
When {{ generation.trigger }}, gain +{{ generation.amount }} Momentum.
{% if generation.limit %}
*({{ generation.limit }})*
{% endif %}
{% if generation.note %}
*Note: {{ generation.note }}*
{% endif %}

{% else %}
**{{ generation_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** +{{ generation }} Momentum
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

All three stances generate comparable Momentum over a full combat—they just reward different tactical approaches.
{% endif %}

### Combat Modifiers

{% if stance.modifiers %}
While in this stance, you gain the following modifiers:

{% if stance.modifiers.damage_bonus %}
**Damage Bonus:** {{ '+' if stance.modifiers.damage_bonus >= 0 else '' }}{{ stance.modifiers.damage_bonus }} to all damage dealt
{% endif %}
{% if stance.modifiers.damage_penalty %}
**Damage Penalty:** {{ stance.modifiers.damage_penalty }} to all damage dealt
{% endif %}
{% if stance.modifiers.defense_bonus %}
**Defense Bonus:** +{{ stance.modifiers.defense_bonus }} to all defense rolls
{% endif %}
{% if stance.modifiers.defense_penalty %}
**Defense Penalty:** {{ stance.modifiers.defense_penalty }} to all defense rolls
{% endif %}

These modifiers apply to every relevant roll while you maintain this stance.
{% endif %}

### Movement

{% if stance.movement %}
{% for movement_aspect, movement_desc in stance.movement.items() %}
{% if movement_desc is mapping %}
**{{ movement_aspect.title() }}**
{{ movement_desc.description }}
{% if movement_desc.bonus %}
Bonus: {{ movement_desc.bonus }}
{% endif %}

{% else %}
**{{ movement_aspect.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ movement_desc }}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

### Special Capability

{% if stance.special_ability %}
**{{ stance.special_ability.name }}**

{{ stance.special_ability.effect }}

This capability is always available while you maintain this stance. It doesn't cost Momentum or actions unless specifically noted.
{% endif %}

{% if stance.advantages %}
### When This Stance Excels

{% for advantage in stance.advantages %}
- {{ advantage }}
{% endfor %}

Choose this stance when these situations describe your tactical position or combat goals.
{% endif %}

{% if stance.tactical_role %}
### Archetype Fit

This stance particularly suits:
{% for role in stance.tactical_role %}
- {{ role }}
{% endfor %}

Any character can use any stance, but these archetypes often find this stance aligns with their natural strengths.
{% endif %}

{% if stance.restrictions %}
### Restrictions

{% for restriction_id, restriction in stance.restrictions.items() %}
**{{ restriction_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ restriction }}

{% endfor %}

These restrictions apply while you maintain this stance. Violating them may require a stance switch or impose mechanical penalties.
{% endif %}

## Understanding Stance Tactics

### Choosing Your Initial Stance

At the start of combat, your stance choice reflects your assessment of the situation and your role in the coming fight.

**Choose Aggressive when:**
- You need to eliminate enemies quickly before they execute their plan
- You're the primary damage dealer and allies can protect themselves
- First strike advantage matters (preventing enemy spellcasting, disrupting formations)
- You want to build Momentum rapidly through successful attacks
- You have high damage output and can capitalize on the damage bonus

**Choose Balanced when:**
- You're uncertain how the fight will develop and want flexibility
- You need to adapt to enemy tactics as they emerge
- Your build benefits from critical successes (critical-focused characters)
- You want the option to switch stance without Momentum cost once this combat
- You're in a support role and need to respond to changing party needs

**Choose Defensive when:**
- You're protecting vulnerable allies who need time to execute plans
- You're outnumbered and survival matters more than speed
- You're a spellcaster who needs to build Momentum safely before unleashing power
- Your role is to absorb enemy attention and attacks
- You expect to take significant damage and need the defense bonus

### Switching Stances Mid-Combat

Stances aren't permanent choices. Combat develops, circumstances change, and effective combatants adapt.

**Switching Cost:**
Most stance switches cost 1 Momentum. However:
- Balanced stance grants one free switch per combat (Tactical Flexibility)
- Switching from Aggressive to Balanced costs 0 Momentum (pressing forward is easy to moderate)
- Switching from Defensive to Balanced might cost Momentum depending on character abilities

**When to Switch:**
Effective combatants recognize when their initial stance no longer serves them:

*Aggressive → Balanced:* When you've eliminated immediate threats and need to reassess the battlefield. The free switch from Aggressive to Balanced makes this transition natural.

*Aggressive → Defensive:* Rare, but appropriate when you've taken heavy damage and need to survive. Costs Momentum, which is why it's uncommon.

*Balanced → Aggressive:* When you've identified the key threat and need to eliminate it quickly. Your free Balanced switch can enable this.

*Balanced → Defensive:* When you realize you're taking more damage than expected and need protection. Your free Balanced switch can enable this.

*Defensive → Balanced:* When you've weathered the initial assault and can now contribute more actively. Typically costs Momentum.

*Defensive → Aggressive:* Very rare. Only makes sense when you've successfully defended and now need to finish weakened enemies before they recover.

### Momentum Generation by Stance

All three stances generate comparable Momentum over a full combat, but through different triggers:

**Aggressive Momentum** comes from successful offense. Hit enemies, deal damage, execute charges, score critical hits. An Aggressive fighter in a typical combat might generate 1-3 Momentum per round through attacking successfully and potentially scoring overwhelm bonuses from criticals.

**Balanced Momentum** comes from exceptional performance. Critical successes on any roll generate Momentum. A Balanced character in a typical combat might generate 1-2 Momentum per round, dependent on achieving 13+ on rolls. This makes Balanced Momentum somewhat variable but rewarding skilled play.

**Defensive Momentum** comes from weathering attacks. Being attacked generates Momentum, successfully defending generates more. A Defensive character in a typical combat might generate 1-3 Momentum per round just by being the target of enemy attacks, with additional Momentum for successful defenses.

The key insight: Aggressive generates Momentum through what you do to enemies. Defensive generates Momentum through what enemies do to you. Balanced generates Momentum through exceptional execution regardless of action type.

### Stance and Archetype Synergy

Different archetypes naturally favor different stances, though any archetype can use any stance effectively:

**Fighter** - Versatile. Can use any stance effectively:
- Aggressive for pure damage output and frontline pressure
- Balanced for tactical flexibility and technique combinations
- Defensive for protecting allies and holding ground

**Ranger** - Primarily Aggressive or Balanced:
- Aggressive suits the mobile skirmisher who hits and repositions
- Balanced provides tactical options for ranged combat
- Defensive less common (light armor and ranged focus make taking hits suboptimal)

**Paladin** - Defensive or Balanced:
- Defensive while serving as party defender (heavy armor supports this role)
- Balanced when balancing martial and magical actions
- Aggressive possible but heavy armor reduces Momentum generation from attacks

**Rogue** - Aggressive or Balanced:
- Aggressive for burst damage when advantaged positioning is achieved
- Balanced for adaptability and responding to changing situations
- Defensive rare (low armor makes sustained defense difficult)

**Wizard/Cleric/Bard** - Defensive or Balanced:
- Defensive to build Momentum safely while staying alive (crucial for fragile spellcasters)
- Balanced when confident in survival and wanting flexibility
- Aggressive rare (low HP and armor make frontline positioning dangerous)

### Party Stance Coordination

A party's collective stance choices create emergent tactics:

**Balanced 4-Person Party:**
- 1 Defensive (defender who protects and generates Momentum while absorbing attacks)
- 2 Aggressive (damage dealers who eliminate threats quickly)
- 1 Balanced (support/utility who adapts to needs)

This provides coverage: someone defends, someone attacks, someone adapts. But many other combinations work:

**All-Aggressive Party** - Glass cannon approach. Eliminate enemies before they can retaliate. High risk, high reward. Works best when party can end fights quickly.

**All-Defensive Party** - Grinding attrition. Weather enemy attacks, build Momentum safely, win through sustainability. Slow but very safe.

**All-Balanced Party** - Maximum tactical flexibility. Every member can adapt to changing circumstances. Works best with skilled players who read battlefield conditions well.

**Mixed Stances** - Most common and recommended. Having different stances in the party creates natural turn order variation and ensures Momentum generation from multiple sources.

## Advanced Stance Tactics

### Stance Dancing

Skilled combatants don't marry their initial stance—they flow between stances as combat develops:

**Opening: Defensive** - Start safely, build Momentum while enemies close distance or reveal their tactics. Generate +1-2 Momentum from being attacked and defending successfully.

**Mid-Combat: Aggressive** - Switch to Aggressive (costs Momentum) after building resources. Spend accumulated Momentum on powerful techniques while dealing increased damage.

**Endgame: Balanced** - Switch to Balanced as combat winds down. Clean up remaining enemies while maintaining defensive options.

This pattern—defend, attack, adapt—creates a combat rhythm that maximizes Momentum economy while minimizing risk.

### Role Swapping

Your stance can change with your role:

**Fighter Example:**
- Starts Aggressive (deal damage, pressure enemies)
- Takes heavy damage from focused enemy attention
- Switches to Defensive (survive, recover)
- Healer restores Fighter
- Switches back to Aggressive (finish weakened enemies)

The ability to change roles mid-combat through stance switching creates dynamic fights that don't lock characters into single approaches.

### Coordinated Stance Changes

Advanced parties coordinate stance switches for tactical advantage:

**Turn Order Manipulation:**
- Rogue starts Aggressive (acts first, eliminates high-value target)
- Switches to Balanced next turn (acts second, responds to enemy tactics)
- This deliberate turn order change creates tactical flexibility

**Momentum Generation Optimization:**
- Wizard starts Defensive (builds Momentum safely)
- Fighter starts Aggressive (generates Momentum through attacks)
- Both parties build resources simultaneously through different methods
- Mid-combat, both have Momentum to spend on powerful options

## Game Master Guidance

### Running Initiative by Stance

Initiative in Autumn Phoenix RPG follows stance priority, not individual speed:

1. **Aggressive combatants** act first, ordered by Awareness (ties broken by Might)
2. **Balanced combatants** act second, ordered by Mind (ties broken by Will)
3. **Defensive combatants** act last, ordered by Will (ties broken by Presence)

This creates predictable turn order that rewards tactical stance selection. Players quickly learn that going Aggressive means acting first but accepting vulnerability.

### Tracking Stance and Momentum

Make stance visible at the table:
- Cards or tokens indicating each character's current stance
- Visible Momentum trackers (poker chips, dice, written trackers)
- When characters switch stance, announce it clearly
- When Momentum is generated, make it explicit ("You hit, +1 Momentum from the attack, +1 additional Momentum from Aggressive stance")

Transparent tracking helps players understand the system and make informed stance decisions.

### Encounter Design for Stance Variety

Design encounters that reward different stances:

**Single Powerful Enemy** - Favors Aggressive stance. Eliminating the threat quickly prevents it from executing devastating attacks.

**Multiple Weak Enemies** - Favors Defensive stance. Weathering many small attacks generates substantial Momentum while allies eliminate threats.

**Mixed Enemy Types** - Favors Balanced stance. Adapting to different threat priorities requires tactical flexibility.

**Environmental Hazards** - Might favor any stance depending on hazard type. Collapsing ceiling favors Aggressive (end fight fast). Ongoing damage zone favors Defensive (survive while solving problem).

Vary encounter design to prevent "always use X stance" syndrome.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Players Forget:**
- Aggressive stance requires moving toward nearest enemy (movement restriction matters)
- Defensive stance grants +2 to defense (significant bonus, don't forget it)
- Balanced stance allows one free switch per combat (use it strategically)
- Aggressive criticals grant additional Momentum (overwhelm bonus is powerful)

**GMs Forget:**
- Initiative is by stance first, then attribute (not just attribute)
- Momentum generation triggers vary by stance (track them separately)
- Special abilities are always active (they don't cost actions)
- Stance modifiers apply to every relevant roll (don't skip them)

Create reference cards or table tents with stance information to reduce forgetting.

### Encouraging Tactical Stance Use

Some players default to one stance and never switch. Encourage experimentation:

**Design fights that punish single-stance play:**
- Fight starts with ranged enemies (Aggressive characters must close distance)
- Mid-fight, enemies close to melee (Defensive becomes valuable)
- Late fight, weakened enemies flee (Balanced flexibility helpful)

**Reward clever stance switching:**
- Player narratively describes why they're switching stance
- Mechanical benefit follows naturally from the switch
- Highlight when stance switch changed combat outcome

**Make Momentum economy visible:**
- Show players how different stances generated different Momentum totals
- Compare Aggressive character's attack-based Momentum to Defensive character's defense-based Momentum
- Demonstrate that all paths work, just differently

### Stance as Narrative Tool

Stances aren't just mechanics—they're narrative signals:

**Aggressive** - Pressing forward, taking initiative, dominating through action
**Balanced** - Assessing the situation, responding thoughtfully, maintaining options
**Defensive** - Weathering the storm, protecting others, enduring through resistance

When players choose stances, they're declaring their character's approach to this fight. Incorporate that into your combat narration.
