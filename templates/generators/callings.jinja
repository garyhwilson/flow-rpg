# CALLINGS - MECHANICAL REFERENCE
*Generated from YAML source data*

## Overview

Callings represent your character's core psychological motivation and worldview. Each calling provides:
- **Flow Benefit** - A mechanical trigger that generates Flow
- **Narrative Permission** - A special ability that shapes roleplay
- **Calling Equipment** - Optional unique item (acquired during play)

Your calling influences how you approach problems, what drives your decisions, and how you generate Flow in play.

## Using Callings in Play

### Flow Generation Strategy
Each calling generates Flow differently. Consider how your calling's trigger aligns with your:
- **Archetype:** Combat style and abilities
- **Stance Preference:** Aggressive, Balanced, or Defensive
- **Party Role:** Defender, damage, support, or utility

### Narrative Permission
Your narrative permission is always available. It's not a spell or technique—it's an innate aspect of your character's perspective. Use it to:
- Gain information without rolling
- Justify unusual character knowledge or preparation
- Create dramatic moments that align with your calling's themes

### Calling Equipment
Calling equipment is earned through play, not purchased:
- GM awards it during significant character moments
- Usually occurs after demonstrating growth or facing your calling's challenges
- Mechanically powerful but limited to once per scene
- Represents your calling becoming manifest in the world

## GM Guidelines for Callings

### Triggering Flow Benefits
- **Be Generous:** If a player is trying to trigger their flow benefit, work with them
- **Scene-Based Limits:** Most benefits have "no limit" but are naturally constrained by circumstances
- **Reliability:** Each calling should trigger 1-3 times per session minimum
- **Party Balance:** Ensure all callings have opportunities to trigger

### Awarding Calling Equipment
Award calling equipment when:
- Character has significant moment related to their calling's theme
- Player demonstrates growth or integration (not just stress behavior)
- Feels dramatically appropriate
- Typically between 3rd-6th session

### Narrative Permissions
- These are designed to never require rolls
- They provide narrative justification, not automatic success at everything
- Can still fail in execution even if the permission gives knowledge/intuition
- Should feel special and unique to that character

*Callings represent the heart of character identity. Mechanics reinforce theme, and theme drives meaningful moments in play.*
