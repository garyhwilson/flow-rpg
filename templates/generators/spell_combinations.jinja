# Spell Combinations

Individual spells solve immediate problems. Fireball eliminates clustered enemies. Shield prevents incoming damage. Heal restores wounded allies. But spellcasters who think only in single-spell terms miss the deeper tactical layer—spell combinations that synergize to create effects greater than their parts.

Spell combinations aren't just "cast multiple spells." They're deliberate sequences that manage Momentum economy while amplifying effectiveness. The wizard who casts two Sparks before Fireball generates Momentum while softening targets. The cleric who layers Mage Armor, Shield, and Blur creates defenses that cost zero net Momentum. These patterns separate competent spellcasters from masters.

## Understanding Spell Synergy

{% if combo_data.description %}
{{ combo_data.description }}. Smart spellcasters don't just cast powerful spells—they create cascading effects where each spell enables the next.
{% endif %}

### Momentum-Positive Sequences

The best spell combinations generate more Momentum than they consume:

**Generate then spend:** Cast cantrips or minor spells to build Momentum reserves, then unleash major spells when you have resources available.

**Critical timing:** Save expensive spells for moments when you can follow them with Momentum-generating actions.

**Layered effects:** Stack multiple zero-cost or low-cost buffs before expending resources on offense.

### Tactical Combinations

Different situations demand different spell sequences:

{% if combo_data.examples %}
{% for combo_id, combo in combo_data.examples.items() %}

#### {{ combo_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if combo.sequence %}**Spell Sequence:** {{ combo.sequence|join(' → ') }}{% endif %}

{% if combo.total_cost %}**Total Momentum Cost:** {{ combo.total_cost }}{% endif %}

{% if combo.effect %}**Tactical Effect:** {{ combo.effect }}{% endif %}

{{ combo.description if combo.description else "" }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Building Effective Combinations

### Defensive Layering

Protection spells stack to create overlapping defenses:

**Mage Armor (Cantrip, 0 Momentum):** Base magical protection active all day
**Shield (Cantrip, 0 Momentum):** Reactive defense against specific attacks
**Blur (Cantrip, 0 Momentum):** Ongoing concealment making you harder to hit

These three cantrips cost zero Momentum total but create significant defensive advantages. Cast them before combat begins—you're protected without resource expenditure.

Add higher-tier protections as threats increase:
- **Stoneskin** for physical damage reduction
- **Resistance** for elemental protection
- **Mind Blank** against psychic attacks

Each layer costs Momentum but solves specific threats. The key is knowing which defenses the current enemy can bypass and which they cannot.

### Offensive Escalation

Build Momentum through minor attacks, then unleash devastating finishers:

**Phase 1 - Generate Momentum:**
- Spark (Cantrip, 0 Momentum) generates Momentum on hit
- Repeated cantrip attacks build Momentum reserves
- Conservative resource management

**Phase 2 - Escalate:**
- Magic Missile (Tier 1, -1 Momentum) for guaranteed damage
- Fireball (Tier 2, -1 Momentum) when enemies cluster
- Lightning Bolt (Tier 2, -1 Momentum) for linear groups

**Phase 3 - Finish:**
- Disintegrate (Tier 3, -2 Momentum) to eliminate priority targets
- Meteor Swarm (Tier 3, -2 Momentum) for area devastation

This progression manages Momentum carefully—you never cast expensive spells at negative Momentum because you built reserves first.

### Control and Setup

Some combinations don't deal damage directly but create situations where damage becomes trivial:

**Web + Fireball:** Immobilize enemies, then burn them while they can't escape
**Fog Cloud + Darkvision:** Blind enemies, dominate while they fumble
**Grease + Ranged Attacks:** Enemies fall prone, archers shoot helpless targets

These combinations require planning and party coordination. The wizard creates the setup spell, allies exploit the advantage. More effective than any single spell alone.

### Healing Chains

Healing becomes more efficient through proper sequencing:

**Stabilize (Cantrip, 0 Momentum):** Stop dying allies from getting worse
**Heal (Tier 1, -1 Momentum):** Restore moderate Vitality to conscious allies
**Mass Heal (Tier 2, -1 Momentum):** Restore entire party after major battle

Don't waste high-tier healing on single targets when cantrips suffice. Reserve expensive healing for emergencies or situations where healing multiple targets justifies the cost.

Healing during combat competes with offensive actions. Sometimes dealing damage to end the fight quickly is better than healing damage already taken. Know when to heal and when to attack.

## Momentum Management Through Combinations

### The Cantrip Foundation

Cantrips cost zero Momentum, making them the backbone of sustainable spellcasting:

**Before Combat:** Layer zero-cost buffs (Mage Armor, Shield, Light)
**During Combat:** Generate Momentum through cantrip attacks (Spark, Acid Splash)
**After Combat:** Utility cantrips solve problems without resource drain (Mending, Prestidigitation)

Never feel pressured to conserve cantrips. Cast them freely—they're designed for unlimited use.

### Tier 1 Spells as Bridges

Tier 1 spells cost -1 Momentum but provide reliable effects:

- Use them when cantrips aren't enough but Tier 2 spells are overkill
- Cast them after generating Momentum from cantrips (net 0 Momentum)
- Combine with party actions for multiplied effectiveness

Magic Missile guarantees damage when you need a specific target eliminated. Bless grants party-wide bonuses without excessive Momentum investment. These spells bridge the gap between cantrip consistency and high-tier power.

### Tier 2+ Spells as Climaxes

Expensive spells should feel climactic—not routine:

**Save them for:**
- Clustered enemies where area spells hit multiple targets
- Priority threats that must die immediately
- Desperate situations requiring maximum power

**Don't waste them on:**
- Single weak enemies
- Situations where cantrips or Tier 1 spells suffice
- Early combat when you might need them later

When you cast Fireball or Disintegrate, it should matter. These aren't casual spells—they're dramatic moments that shift combat decisively.

## Advanced Combination Tactics

### Turn Efficiency

Spells with different casting times enable complex sequences:

**Bonus Action Spells:** Cast alongside normal actions for double spell turns
**Reaction Spells:** Trigger off enemy actions (Counterspell, Shield)
**Concentration Spells:** Maintain ongoing effects while casting other spells

A wizard maintaining Haste (concentration) can still cast Fireball on their turn. The cleric concentrating on Bless still throws cantrip attacks. Concentration spells provide persistent benefits without preventing other casting.

### Attribute Flexibility

The same spell cast with different attributes creates different combinations:

**Mind-based Damage + Awareness-based Utility:** Fireball with Mind for maximum damage, Detect Magic with Awareness for perfect information
**Will-based Buffs + Presence-based Debuffs:** Shield with Will for absolute protection, Charm with Presence for social dominance

Mix attributes within combinations to leverage your strengths across different spell functions.

### Multiclass Synergies

Characters with multiple spellcasting archetypes (Wizard/Cleric, Paladin/Ranger) access broader spell combinations:

**Wizard/Cleric:** Arcane damage + Divine healing creates self-sufficient caster
**Paladin/Wizard:** Martial melee + Magical buffs enhances both capabilities
**Ranger/Cleric:** Nature spells + Healing supports wilderness adventures

These combinations require careful build planning but provide versatility single-class casters cannot match.

## Game Master Guidance

### Encouraging Combination Play

Don't punish players for clever spell combinations—reward them:

**Recognize synergy:** When a player executes a well-planned combination, acknowledge the tactical thinking
**Create opportunities:** Design encounters with clustered enemies (rewarding area spells) or specific vulnerabilities (rewarding targeted combinations)
**Allow creativity:** If a player proposes a spell combination that makes sense narratively, find ways to make it work mechanically

### Balancing Spell Combinations

Combinations should feel powerful without being overwhelming:

**Acceptable:** Web + Fireball combo that immobilizes and damages enemies (requires two spell slots, coordination, and proper positioning)
**Too Strong:** Infinite combo that locks enemies permanently with no counterplay
**Too Weak:** Combination that costs excessive resources for minimal benefit

If a combination feels too powerful, examine whether it requires:
- Multiple party members coordinating
- Specific positioning or circumstances
- Significant resource investment
- Enemies failing saves or checks

Most combinations that require these elements are balanced through their constraints.

### Countering Combinations

Enemies can use spell combinations too:

**Intelligent casters:** Use defensive layers like player wizards
**Major confrontations:** Combine buffs before combat begins
**Villain tactics:** Counter player combinations with Dispel Magic, Counterspell, or tactical positioning

When enemies use combinations effectively, it demonstrates that the magic system works consistently for everyone—and raises the tactical stakes.
