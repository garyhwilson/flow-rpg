# Campaign Tracker

Running a campaign means juggling story threads, tracking character progression, remembering NPC motivations, and maintaining pacing across multiple sessions. Campaign tracking transforms scattered notes into organized systems that help you run better games while reducing prep stress.

Good campaign tracking answers three critical questions: Where have we been? Where are we now? Where are we going? The tools below help you answer those questions quickly during prep and at the table.

## XP and Advancement Tracking

The most critical tracking: character advancement. Autumn Phoenix RPG uses XP-based advancement with a Rank system—characters advance by earning XP each session and accumulating advances. Track these systematically to ensure consistent progression:

### XP Awards and Timing

**XP Per Session:** Award 3-5 XP at the end of every session
- **3 XP (Routine):** Standard session, basic progress
- **4 XP (Good):** Solid progress, meaningful moments
- **5 XP (Exceptional):** Major achievements, memorable session

**Advancement:** 5 XP = 1 Advance

**Rank Progression:**
| Rank | Advances Required | Typical Sessions |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Novice | 0-3 advances | Sessions 1-8 |
| Seasoned | 4-7 advances | Sessions 9-16 |
| Veteran | 8-11 advances | Sessions 17-24 |
| Heroic | 12-15 advances | Sessions 25-32 |
| Legendary | 16+ advances | Sessions 33+ |

### Tracking Sheet Example

**Campaign:** The Dragon's Conspiracy
**Session:** 15 of planned 40

| Character | XP Total | Advances | Current Rank | Next Rank At |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Kara (Fighter) | 58 | 11 | Veteran | 12 advances |
| Theron (Wizard) | 56 | 11 | Veteran | 12 advances |
| Lyra (Rogue) | 60 | 12 | Heroic | Already there |

**Advance Choices This Arc:**
- Kara: Raised Might to +3, took Tough specialty
- Theron: Learned Whirlwind Strike technique
- Lyra: Raised Athletics to Expert

**Note:** Party approaching Heroic rank—consider introducing Heroic-tier challenges.

## Story Thread Tracking

Campaigns involve multiple simultaneous plots. Track them to maintain coherence and provide satisfying resolutions:

### Active Threads

Plots currently driving session content:

**Thread 1: The Dragon Conspiracy**
- Status: Climax approaching
- Next Step: Party raids ritual site
- Stakes: City destruction if ritual completes
- Timeline: 3 days in-game time

**Thread 2: Marcella's Betrayal**
- Status: Background mystery
- Next Step: Party discovers her coded messages
- Stakes: Trusted ally is actually informant
- Timeline: Revelation session 18-19

### Background Threads

Plots developing off-screen, emerging later:

**Thread 3: The Thieves' Guild Power Struggle**
- Status: Developing
- Trigger: When party returns to city
- Stakes: Guild war erupts, collateral damage
- Timeline: Sessions 20-22

### Resolved Threads

Completed plots (useful for continuity):

**Thread A: The Bandit King** (Resolved Session 8)
- Outcome: Defeated, territory claimed by legitimate authorities
- Consequences: Party gained regional fame

## NPC Roster

Track important NPCs to maintain consistent characterization:

{% if npc_generation and npc_generation.memorable_traits %}
### Quick NPC Template

For each important NPC, record:

**Name:** [Character name]
**Role:** [Relationship to party]
**Motivation:** [What do they want?]
**Memorable Trait:** [One distinctive feature]
**Status:** [Where are they now?]

### Example NPCs

**Captain Aldric Thorne**
- Role: City guard contact, occasional ally
- Motivation: Maintain order while protecting citizens from corrupt nobles
- Memorable Trait: Missing left hand, replaced with ornate hook
- Status: Investigating noble involvement in cult

**Seraphine the Red**
- Role: Informant, unreliable ally
- Motivation: Profit and survival above all else
- Memorable Trait: Whispers everything, even in safe locations
- Status: Disappeared after double-crossing party (session 12)

{% else %}

**Name | Role | Motivation | Trait | Status**
- Captain Thorne | Guard ally | Maintain order | Hook hand | Investigating cult
- Seraphine | Informant | Personal profit | Always whispers | Missing
- Elder Korrin | Quest giver | Protect village | Prophetic dreams | Waiting for report

{% endif %}

---

## Session Structure Tracking

{% if campaign_management and campaign_management.session_structure %}
Maintain pacing by structuring sessions consistently:

{% if campaign_management.session_structure.opening %}
### Opening (15-20 minutes)
{% for element, description in campaign_management.session_structure.opening.items() %}
- **{{ element.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if campaign_management.session_structure.rising_action %}
### Rising Action (60-90 minutes)
{% for element, description in campaign_management.session_structure.rising_action.items() %}
- **{{ element.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if campaign_management.session_structure.climax %}
### Climax (30-45 minutes)
{% for element, description in campaign_management.session_structure.climax.items() %}
- **{{ element.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if campaign_management.session_structure.resolution %}
### Resolution (15-30 minutes)
{% for element, description in campaign_management.session_structure.resolution.items() %}
- **{{ element.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% else %}

**Opening:** Recap, intentions, Momentum check, scene setting
**Rising Action:** 2-3 encounters, building tension, complications
**Climax:** Major challenge, peak resources, decisive moment
**Resolution:** Consequences, XP awards, hooks, Momentum reset

{% endif %}

---

## Campaign Type Tracking

{% if campaign_management and campaign_management.campaign_types %}
Different campaign styles require different tracking approaches:

{% for type_id, campaign_type in campaign_management.campaign_types.items() %}
### {{ type_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

**Description:** {{ campaign_type.description if campaign_type.description else "Campaign focusing on different storytelling approach" }}
{% if campaign_type.momentum_reset %}**Momentum Reset:** {{ campaign_type.momentum_reset }}{% endif %}
{% if campaign_type.advancement %}**Advancement:** {{ campaign_type.advancement }}{% endif %}
{% if campaign_type.benefits %}**Benefits:** {{ campaign_type.benefits }}{% endif %}

{% if type_id == 'episodic' %}**Tracking Needs:** Minimal—each session self-contained, track character sheets and XP totals only.{% endif %}
{% if type_id == 'serial' %}**Tracking Needs:** Full tracking—maintain NPC roster, story threads, ongoing consequences across sessions.{% endif %}
{% if type_id == 'sandbox' %}**Tracking Needs:** Location-based—track regions, factions, discovered locations, and available quests.{% endif %}
{% if type_id == 'hybrid' %}**Tracking Needs:** Moderate—track main story arc thoroughly, episodic elements lightly.{% endif %}

---
{% endfor %}

{% else %}

**Episodic:** Self-contained adventures, minimal tracking
**Serial:** Connected story, full NPC/thread tracking
**Sandbox:** Location-based, track regions and factions
**Hybrid:** Main arc + episodic elements, moderate tracking

{% endif %}

---

## Pacing Tools

{% if campaign_management and campaign_management.pacing_tools %}

{% if campaign_management.pacing_tools.tension_management %}
### Tension Management

{% if campaign_management.pacing_tools.tension_management.build_tension %}
**Build Tension When:**
{% for technique in campaign_management.pacing_tools.tension_management.build_tension %}
- {{ technique }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if campaign_management.pacing_tools.tension_management.release_tension %}
**Release Tension When:**
{% for technique in campaign_management.pacing_tools.tension_management.release_tension %}
- {{ technique }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if campaign_management.pacing_tools.momentum_pacing %}
### Momentum Pacing Across Session

{% for phase, description in campaign_management.pacing_tools.momentum_pacing.items() %}
**{{ phase.replace('_', ' ').title() }}:** {{ description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% else %}

**Build Tension:** Add time pressure, reveal stakes gradually, increase hazards
**Release Tension:** Comic relief, safe havens, minor victories, resource discovery

**Momentum Pacing:** Slow start → midpoint spike → climax (max Momentum) → denouement

{% endif %}

## Scaling Challenges by Rank

As the party advances through ranks, scale challenge difficulty:

| Party Rank | Standard TN | Hard TN | Story Stakes |
|------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Novice | TN 8 | TN 10 | Local threats, personal stakes |
| Seasoned | TN 10 | TN 12 | Regional threats, community stakes |
| Veteran | TN 10 | TN 12 | Kingdom-wide threats, political stakes |
| Heroic | TN 12 | TN 14 | Continental threats, legendary stakes |
| Legendary | TN 12 | TN 14 | World-ending threats, mythic stakes |

**Note:** After characters reach the +5 modifier cap (timing varies by build), challenges scale through complexity and stakes rather than raw difficulty numbers. Scale TNs based on party modifier, not rank.

*Campaign tracking transforms scattered notes into organized systems. Invest fifteen minutes after each session updating your tracker—you'll save hours of prep time and run dramatically better games.*
