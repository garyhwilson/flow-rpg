## Overview

Species represents your character's heritage and innate capabilities. Each species provides:
- **Attribute Bonus** - A +1 bonus to one or more attributes
- **Three Species Traits** - Unique mechanical abilities

## Choosing Your Species

### Character Creation Impact

**Attribute Bonuses:**
- Species bonus stacks with your starting attribute array
- Choose bonus based on your desired archetype's primary attributes
- Flexible bonuses (Human, Elf choices) offer more build variety

**Species Traits:**
- All three traits are always active
- No choices needed—you get all three
- Traits never conflict with class abilities
- Unique mechanics that stay relevant throughout the campaign

### Species and Flow Economy

Each species interacts with Flow differently:

**Humans:** Excel when recovering from setbacks (negative Flow bonus)
- Strategy: Take calculated risks, benefit from adversity
- Synergy: Works with any playstyle that accepts setbacks

**Elves:** Generate extra Flow from excellence (critical success bonus)
- Strategy: Build high skill bonuses to trigger crits more often
- Synergy: Skill-focused characters, high attribute builds

**Dwarves:** Protected economy, stable Flow (reduces Vitality loss, free defensive switches)
- Strategy: Defensive play, resource conservation
- Synergy: Defensive characters, defenders, careful tacticians

**Halflings:** Flow protection and support generation (prevent negative, gain from ally setbacks)
- Strategy: Team player, safety net for party
- Synergy: Support characters, party leaders, tactical coordinators

### Species and Callings

While any species can take any calling, some combinations create natural synergies:

**Natural Synergies** (from YAML):
- **Humans:** No pattern—truly any calling works equally well
- **Elves:** Scholar, Seeker, Mediator (introspective, magical, diplomatic)
- **Dwarves:** Sentinel, Guardian, Advocate (protective, moral, steadfast)
- **Halflings:** Enthusiast, Guardian, Mediator (optimistic, caring, peaceful)

**Against-Type Builds:**
Playing against natural affinities creates interesting character concepts:
- Dwarf Seeker: Finding identity through ancient stone
- Elf Champion: Pursuing perfection through competition
- Halfling Sentinel: Vigilant protector despite small size
- Human Scholar: Compensating for short lifespan with knowledge

### Species and Archetypes

**Natural Synergies** (from YAML):
- **Humans:** Any archetype—human versatility supports all playstyles
- **Elves:** Wizard, Ranger, Bard (magical, graceful, intuitive)
- **Dwarves:** Fighter, Paladin, Cleric (martial, devoted, resilient)
- **Halflings:** Rogue, Bard, Cleric (nimble, charismatic, supportive)

**Attribute Bonus Efficiency:**
- Match species bonus to archetype primary attributes
- Flexible bonuses let you optimize any build
- Fixed bonuses reward appropriate class choices

### Mechanical Considerations

**Spellcasters:**
- **Elf:** Ignore first armor penalty point (wear light armor freely)
- **Human:** Extra skill tier helps meet magic access requirements
- **Dwarf/Halfling:** Will bonus aids divine magic access

**Martial Characters:**
- **Dwarf:** Stone Endurance makes frontline safer
- **Elf:** Fey Grace rewards aggressive stance crits
- **Human:** Skill versatility adds utility to combat builds
- **Halfling:** Mobility traits enable skirmisher tactics

**Skill Specialists:**
- **Human:** Versatile trait gives extra skill or tier upgrade
- **Human:** Adaptable lets you retrain skills
- **Dwarf:** Craftwise provides guaranteed information
- **Halfling:** Small But Mighty makes stealth exceptionally reliable

## GM Guidelines for Species

### Balancing Species Traits

All four species are designed to be mechanically balanced:
- Each gets exactly 3 traits
- Traits are situational—not "always on" bonuses
- Flow interactions vary but average similar benefit
- No species dominates any specific role

### Encouraging Diversity

- Don't push players toward "optimal" species choices
- Reward creative use of species traits
- Make traits relevant in different scenes
- Validate against-type character concepts

### Species in Your World

The species as written assume:
- All four species are common and integrated
- No species is evil or monstrous
- Cultural differences exist but aren't mechanically enforced
- Players can reflavor species traits narratively

Feel free to adjust:
- Species descriptions to fit your setting
- Add new species using these as templates
- Rename species while keeping mechanics
- Create cultural variants with trait swaps

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I play other species?**
A: Work with GM to reskin existing species or create new ones with similar trait structure.

**Q: What if my species doesn't match my calling/archetype?**
A: That's fine! Species and class are separate mechanical choices. Natural affinities are just common patterns, not restrictions.

**Q: Do I have to use my attribute bonus on the listed attributes?**
A: If it says "choice," you can pick from those options. Humans can choose any attribute.

**Q: Can species traits be improved?**
A: Traits remain as written. Use edges or milestones to enhance related abilities.
