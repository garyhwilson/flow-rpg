# Species and Heritage

Before you were a fighter or a wizard, before you chose your calling or picked up your first weapon, you were born into a heritage that shapes how you experience the world. Species represents your innate capabilities—the advantages and perspectives that come from your fundamental nature.

Every species in Autumn Phoenix RPG provides the same mechanical structure: an attribute bonus and three unique traits. These choices matter throughout your career, not just at creation. Your species shapes how you generate Momentum, how you interact with the world, and what unique capabilities you bring to your party.

{% for species_id, species in species_data.items() %}

## {{ species.name }}

*{{ species.description }}*

### Innate Capability

{% if species.attribute_bonus.choice == "any" %}
**Flexible Attribute:** +{{ species.attribute_bonus.amount }} to any one attribute of your choice
{% elif species.attribute_bonus.choice is string %}
**Natural Affinity:** +{{ species.attribute_bonus.amount }} to {{ species.attribute_bonus.choice.title() }}
{% else %}
**Heritage Advantage:** +{{ species.attribute_bonus.amount }} to {{ species.attribute_bonus.choice|join(' or ')|title }} (your choice)
{% endif %}

This bonus reflects natural aptitudes that emerge from your species' typical physiology and cultural patterns. It stacks with your starting attribute array, helping you excel in areas that align with your heritage.

### Species Traits

{% for trait_id, trait in species.species_traits.items() %}

**{{ trait_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}**
{{ trait.effect }}
*{{ trait.type.replace('_', ' ').title() }}*

{% endfor %}

All three traits are always active. You don't choose between them—your heritage provides all of these capabilities simultaneously. They represent fundamental aspects of how your species experiences and interacts with the world.

### Cultural Patterns

{% if species.natural_callings is string %}
Common callings among {{ species.name }}: {{ species.natural_callings }}
{% else %}
Common callings among {{ species.name }}: {{ species.natural_callings|join(', ')|title }}
{% endif %}

{% if species.natural_archetypes is string %}
Typical professions: {{ species.natural_archetypes }}
{% else %}
Typical professions: {{ species.natural_archetypes|join(', ')|title }}
{% endif %}

These patterns reflect tendencies, not restrictions. Any {{species.name}} can embody any calling or pursue any archetype. These connections simply describe what emerges naturally from cultural and physiological patterns—not what's required or optimal.

{% endfor %}

## Choosing Your Species

### Attribute Synergy

Your species attribute bonus should typically align with your intended archetype's primary attributes:

**Flexible bonuses** (Human's "any attribute") offer maximum build variety. Choose the attribute your archetype uses most—Might for fighters, Mind or Awareness for wizards, Presence for bards.

**Fixed bonuses** reward archetypal builds while supporting variety. A species with +1 Might naturally suits martial characters, but the other two traits might enable surprising builds—a Might-bonus species with magic-enhancing traits could create an unusual but viable spellsword.

**Choice bonuses** (select from 2-3 options) provide directed flexibility. You have options, but they're constrained to attributes that align with your species' nature.

### Momentum Economy Differences

Each species interacts with Momentum through unique mechanical frameworks:

**Humans** excel when recovering from adversity. Their traits trigger when things go wrong—negative Momentum situations, setbacks, complications. This creates a playstyle that accepts calculated risks and turns disadvantages into advantages. Human characters often have the most dramatic swings in combat—desperate situations where their unique traits activate.

**Elves** generate extra Momentum from excellence. Critical successes trigger additional benefits beyond normal critical rewards. This creates a playstyle that builds high bonuses to trigger criticals more frequently. Elf characters reward skillful play and high attributes—when you're good at something, you're *very* good at it.

**Dwarves** maintain protected, stable Momentum economies. Their traits reduce costs (Vitality loss, stance switching) rather than generating additional Momentum. This creates a playstyle focused on resource conservation and defensive play. Dwarf characters are predictable and reliable—they maintain consistent performance rather than spiking dramatically.

**Halflings** create Momentum safety nets for themselves and allies. They prevent negative Momentum states and gain resources when party members face setbacks. This creates a support playstyle that keeps the party's overall Momentum economy healthy. Halfling characters work best in team-oriented parties where protecting allies matters.

### Species and Calling

While any species can embody any calling, some combinations create natural thematic resonance:

{% for species_id, species in species_data.items() %}
**{{ species.name }}**: {{ species.natural_callings|join(', ')|title if species.natural_callings is not string else species.natural_callings }}
{% endfor %}

These aren't mechanical optimizations—they're thematic patterns. Playing against type creates interesting character concepts:

- A Dwarf Seeker finding identity through ancient stone and craft traditions
- An Elf Champion pursuing excellence through competition and perfection
- A Halfling Sentinel maintaining vigilant watch despite small stature
- A Human Scholar compensating for brief lifespan through accumulated knowledge

The system supports whatever concept interests you.

### Mechanical Considerations

**For spellcasters:**
Species traits that modify spellcasting penalties, provide magical bonuses, or enhance Momentum generation make casting easier. Check your chosen species' traits for synergies with Sorcery and magical traditions.

**For martial characters:**
Species traits that enhance durability, provide combat bonuses, or generate Momentum through martial actions support frontline roles. Physical attribute bonuses align naturally with fighter, paladin, and ranger archetypes.

**For skill specialists:**
Species traits that provide automatic successes, extra training, or skill bonuses enable specialist builds. Rogues and bards particularly benefit from non-combat skill enhancements.

## Game Master Guidance

### Balancing Species

All species are designed for mechanical balance:
- Each receives exactly one attribute bonus and three traits
- Traits are situational, not constant passive bonuses
- Momentum economy differences average similar total benefit
- No species dominates any archetype or role

Don't push players toward "optimal" species choices. Support creative builds and against-type concepts. The human wizard and elf barbarian both work mechanically.

### Species in Your World

The species as written assume:
- All species are common and socially integrated
- No species is inherently evil or monstrous
- Cultural differences exist but aren't mechanically enforced
- Players can reflavor traits and descriptions to fit your setting

Customize freely:
- Adjust species descriptions to match your world's cultures
- Create new species using the same structure (one attribute bonus, three traits)
- Rename species while keeping mechanics
- Design cultural variants with trait substitutions

### Encouraging Diversity

Make all species traits relevant during play:
- Create situations where each species' unique traits solve problems
- Highlight when species abilities change outcomes
- Don't punish players for "suboptimal" species/class combinations
- Validate creative uses of species traits

### Common Questions

**Can I play other species not listed?**
Work with your GM to adapt existing species mechanically while describing your preferred heritage. The mechanics represent capability frameworks; the narrative can be anything.

**What if my species doesn't match my calling or archetype?**
That's perfectly fine. Species provides mechanical benefits and thematic flavor, but it doesn't restrict your choices. Natural affinities describe patterns, not requirements.

**Can species traits improve?**
Traits remain as written throughout your career. Use edges, milestones, and magical items to enhance related capabilities, but the base traits don't level up. They represent fundamental heritage, not learned skills.

**Do I have to use my attribute bonus on the listed attributes?**
If your species provides "choice" between specific attributes, select from those options. If it says "any attribute" (like humans), choose any. Fixed bonuses apply automatically.

*Your species represents where you come from, but your choices define who you become.*
