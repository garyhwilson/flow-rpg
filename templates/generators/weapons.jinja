**Attack Roll:** 2d6 + [Might or Grace] + Combat skill

## Weapon Selection Guide

### By Character Type

**Might-Based Fighters:**
- **Heavy Weapons:** Maximum damage (2d6+2), two-handed
- **Medium Weapons:** Balanced damage (2d6+1), versatile
- **Light Weapons:** Lower damage but allow shield

**Grace-Based Fighters:**
- **Light Weapons:** Full damage (2d6), +1 Finesse actions
- **Ranged Weapons:** Attack from safety (2d6 at Far)
- **Medium Weapons:** Balanced option if using Grace

**Versatile Combatants:**
- **Medium Weapons:** Can use Might or Grace
- **Reach Weapons:** Might or Grace, tactical positioning
- **Light Weapons:** Might or Grace, most flexible

### By Combat Role

**Frontline Tank:**
- Medium weapon + shield (best defense)
- Heavy weapon (maximum threat)
- Light weapon + shield (if Grace-based)

**Damage Dealer:**
- Heavy weapons (2d6+2 base)
- Medium weapons with critical bonuses (Battle Axe)
- Ranged weapons with positioning

**Skirmisher:**
- Light weapons (mobility)
- Thrown weapons (flexible range)
- Reach weapons (safe distance)

**Archer:**
- Longbow (+1 damage at Far)
- Shortbow (standard ranged)
- Crossbow (armor penetration)

### Damage Comparison

**Base Damage by Category:**
- Heavy: 2d6+2 (average 9)
- Medium: 2d6+1 (average 8)
- Light/Reach/Thrown/Ranged: 2d6 (average 7)

**Plus Attribute Modifier:**
- With +2 attribute: +2 to average
- With +3 attribute: +3 to average

**Example:** Heavy weapon wielder with Might +2:
- Roll: 2d6+2 (weapon) +2 (Might) = 2d6+4
- Average: 11 damage per hit

### Special Properties Explained

**Category-Wide:**
- **Light Weapons:** +1 to Finesse actions (picking locks, sleight of hand while armed)
- **Heavy Weapons:** -1 Grace while wielding (constant penalty, even out of combat)
- **Reach Weapons:** Attack from Close range (one zone away, safer positioning)
- **Thrown Weapons:** +1 Flow when hit at Close (reward for risky throws)
- **Ranged Weapons:** +1 damage at Far, -2 when Engaged (range matters)

**Individual Weapon Specials:**
- **Versatile:** Use two-handed for +1 damage (longsword: 2d6+2 two-handed)
- **Ignores DR:** Bypasses X points of damage reduction (mace, heavy crossbow)
- **Critical Bonuses:** Extra effect on critical hits (greatsword cleave, greataxe ×3)
- **Reach/Brace:** Can hit first when enemies approach
- **Loading:** Fire every other turn (crossbows trade speed for power)
- **Concealable:** Hidden weapons (dagger, easy to smuggle)

### Weapon Upgrades

Characters typically upgrade weapons through:

**Quality Improvements:**
- Masterwork: +1 to hit (not damage)
- Silvered: Affects certain creatures
- Cold Iron: Affects fey creatures

**Magical Enhancement:**
- +1: Bonus to hit and damage
- +2: Greater bonus
- +3: Maximum mundane bonus

**Special Properties:**
- Flaming, Frost, Shocking
- Keen (improved critical range)
- Defending (transfer bonus to Guard)

### Tactical Considerations

**Shields:**
- +2 Guard (significant survivability)
- Requires one hand (limits weapon choice)
- Can't use Heavy or two-handed weapons

**Two-Handed Weapons:**
- Can't use shield
- Typically higher damage
- Free hand unavailable (no torch, items, etc.)

**Dual Wielding:**
- Not directly supported mechanically
- Flavor with light weapons
- No damage bonus (already using Might/Grace)

**Weapon Switching:**
- Free action once per turn
- Keep multiple weapons ready
- Adapt to range changes

### By Archetype

**Fighter Starting:**
- "Martial weapon and shield" = Any medium weapon + shield
- Most flexible starting loadout
- Can swap for heavy two-handed instead

**Ranger Starting:**
- "Bow and hunting knife" = Longbow or shortbow + dagger
- Ranged specialist with backup weapon
- Mobile combatant

**Paladin Starting:**
- "Weapon and holy symbol" = Usually medium weapon
- Heavy armor allows heavy weapon
- Shield optional

**Rogue Starting:**
- "Daggers and shortbow" = Multiple light weapons + ranged
- Versatile loadout for infiltration
- All weapons concealable

**Bard Starting:**
- "Rapier and dagger" = Grace-focused light weapons
- Stylish and effective
- Both work with Performance

**Wizard/Cleric:**
- "Staff/wand" or "Mace" = Simple weapons
- Not the focus, but functional
- Typically casting instead

## GM Guidelines for Weapons

### Treasure and Rewards

**Wealth-Based Upgrades:**
- Let players buy better weapons in cities
- Price progression: Normal → Masterwork → +1 → +2 → +3
- Magic weapons are treasure, not purchases (usually)

**Signature Weapons:**
- Players often bond with specific weapons
- Allow upgrades rather than forcing replacements
- Named weapons create stories

### Weapon Specials in Play

**Versatile Weapons:**
- Switching hands is free action
- Two-handed mode incompatible with shield
- Useful for adapting to threats

**Reach Weapons:**
- Actually enforce Close range advantages
- Let reach users strike first against chargers
- Reach is less useful in confined spaces

**Loading Weapons:**
- Crossbows fire every other turn
- High damage compensates
- Can't full-attack with loading weapons

**Throwable Weapons:**
- Most light weapons can be thrown (Close range)
- Specific thrown weapons go farther
- Thrown weapons aren't automatically retrieved

### Balance Notes

**Damage Differences Are Small:**
- Heavy weapon: 2d6+2 (avg 9)
- Light weapon: 2d6 (avg 7)
- 2 damage difference per hit isn't huge
- Other factors matter: armor compatibility, attributes, playstyle

**Special Properties Matter:**
- Weapon choice is about tactical options, not pure damage
- Let players express character through weapon choice
- All weapon categories are viable

### Common Mistakes

**Don't forget:**
- Heavy weapon Grace penalty applies constantly
- Ranged weapons have Engaged penalty
- Loading weapons fire every other turn
- Two-handed weapons prevent shield use

**Do remember:**
- Players add attribute modifier to damage
- Aggressive stance adds +1 damage
- Critical hits add tier bonus
- Weapon damage is before DR

## Improvised and Unusual Weapons

**Improvised Weapons:**
- Use light weapon stats (2d6)
- No special properties
- May break on critical failure

**Unarmed Strikes:**
- Count as light weapons
- 2d6 damage (monks are skilled unarmed)
- Might or Grace
- Can't be disarmed

**Exotic Weapons:**
- Work with GM to stat custom weapons
- Use existing category as base
- Add special property for uniqueness

*Weapon choice expresses character identity as much as effectiveness. A greataxe-wielding berserker and rapier-dancing duelist both work—they just tell different stories.*
