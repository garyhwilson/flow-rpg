# EDGES
*Generated from YAML source data*

Edges are minor improvements you can take at minor milestones instead of advancing skills or attributes. They represent specialized training, natural talents, or earned benefits.

**Acquisition:** Minor milestones (every 1-2 sessions), roleplay rewards, quest rewards

---

## Available Edges

{% if milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.combat_edges.list %}
{% for edge_id, edge in milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.combat_edges.list.items() %}
### {{ edge_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

**Effect:** {{ edge.effect }}
{% if edge.limit %}
**Limit:** {{ edge.limit }}
{% endif %}
{% if edge.examples %}
**Examples:** {{ edge.examples|join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.skill_edges.examples %}
### Skill Specialization

**Effect:** +1 to specific application of a skill
**Limit:** Multiple allowed (different applications)

**Examples:**
{% for skill, applications in milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.skill_edges.examples.items() %}
- **{{ skill.title() }}:** {{ applications|join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

## Building With Edges

### Defensive Fighter

Take if you want to survive on the front line:

1. **Tough** (+2 Guard)
2. **Tough** again (+2 more Guard, total +4)
3. **Hardy** (+2 Vitality)
4. **Defensive Fighter** (+1 Guard in Defensive stance)

Result: Much harder to kill, can protect squishier allies

### Weapon Specialist

Take if you want reliable damage with your signature weapon:

1. **Weapon Technique** (special maneuver with your weapon type)
2. Eventually **Precise Strike** (reroll damage die)
3. Later milestones: weapon mastery chain if building toward it

Result: Consistent, reliable damage dealer

### Flow Master

Take if you use techniques or spells frequently:

1. **Flow Harmony** (+1 max Flow)
2. **Flow Harmony** (+1 more max, total +2)
3. **Flow Harmony** (+1 more max, total +3)

Result: More Flow to spend on techniques, spells, and abilities

### Versatile Specialist

Take if you want to excel in specific situations:

1. **Skill Specialization:** Stealth (Urban environments)
2. **Skill Specialization:** Combat (Dueling)
3. **Skill Specialization:** Empathy (Reading lies)

Result: Exceptionally good in your specialty areas

### Adaptable Fighter

Take if you want tactical flexibility:

1. **Armor Adaptation** (reduce armor penalty for specific action)
2. **Combat Style** (+1 to specific combat situation)
3. **Quick Draw** (switch weapons free)

Result: Adapt to different tactical situations

## Edge Stacking

**Edges That Stack:**
- Weapon Technique (one per weapon type)
- Armor Adaptation (one per armor type)
- Tough (max 2 times total)
- Hardy (max 2 times total)
- Flow Harmony (max 3 times total)
- Skill Specialization (different applications)

**Edges That Don't Stack:**
- Quick Draw (once only)
- Combat Reflexes (once only)
- Fast Movement (once only)
- Precise Strike (once only)
- Defensive Fighter (once only)

## How GMs Award Edges

### At Minor Milestones

Players choose from available edges, or can take skill/attribute advancement instead. Encourage variety but don't force it.

### As Roleplay Rewards

Social edges like **Reputation** ("+1 with specific group"), **Contact** ("ally in specific location"), or **Language** can be earned through play without spending milestones.

### As Quest Rewards

Unique edges tied to story beats:
- **Heirloom Weapon:** weapon gains minor magic property
- **Masterwork Tools:** +1 to craft/profession
- **Lucky Charm:** reroll one die per scene

Make these feel special and earned.

## Creating Custom Edges

**Power Level Guidelines:**
- +1 to specific narrow application
- +2 to very specific, limited use
- Reroll one die in specific situation
- Narrative permission for unique action

**Example Custom Edge:**

**Shadow Step**
- **Effect:** Once per scene, teleport to shadow within Near range
- **Limit:** Once only
- **Requirement:** Stealth Professional or higher

---

## Balance Considerations

**All edges should be:**
- Comparable in power to +1 skill tier in specific situation
- Useful but not mandatory
- Create variety, not power creep
- Support character concept

**Watch out for:**
- Stacking too many Guard/Vitality edges (limit 2 each)
- Taking only combat edges (encourage variety)
- Edges that obsolete skills
- Combinations that create overpowered synergies

---

*Edges represent the small choices that make each character unique. Two fighters with identical skills can play completely differently through edge selection.*
