# Edges and Specialization

As adventurers grow in power, they develop unique capabilities that set them apart from others of similar training. These edges represent specialized techniques, natural talents, and hard-won expertise—the small choices that define who you are as a hero.

## What Are Edges?

At each minor milestone (typically every 1-2 sessions), you may choose to take an edge instead of advancing a skill or attribute. While skills and attributes measure broad capability, edges represent focused specialization in narrow areas.

Some edges can also be earned through play without spending milestones—social connections, languages, and unique story rewards can emerge naturally from your adventures.

---

## Edge Descriptions

The following edges are available to all characters. Your GM may introduce additional edges specific to your campaign.

{% if milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.combat_edges.list %}
{% for edge_id, edge in milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.combat_edges.list.items() %}

### {{ edge_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{{ edge.effect }}.
{% if edge.examples %}

**{{ edge_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }} in Action:**
{% if edge.examples is string %}
{{ edge.examples }}
{% else %}
{% for example in edge.examples %}
- {{ example }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if edge.limit %}

**Limit:** {{ edge.limit }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.skill_edges.examples %}

### Skill Specialization

Rather than improving your skill across all situations, you can instead gain +1 to a specific application of that skill. This represents the kind of focused expertise that comes from repeated experience in particular circumstances.

Unlike most edges, you can take Skill Specialization multiple times as long as each application is different. A character might specialize in Urban Stealth, Combat Dueling, and Empathy for Reading Lies—each a distinct narrow use of a broader skill.

**Examples of Skill Specializations:**
{% for skill, applications in milestone_data.minor_milestones.options.skill_edges.examples.items() %}
- **{{ skill.title() }}:** {{ applications|join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}

**Limit:** Multiple allowed (different applications)

{% endif %}

## Building Your Character With Edges

Rather than listing every possible edge combination, here are proven builds that demonstrate how edges work together to create distinct character concepts. Use these as inspiration or follow them exactly—both approaches work.

### Defensive Fighter

If you want to survive on the front line and protect your allies, this build emphasizes durability:

1. **Tough** (+2 Guard)
2. **Tough** again (+2 more Guard, total +4)
3. **Hardy** (+2 Vitality)
4. **Defensive Fighter** (+1 Guard in Defensive stance)

**Result:** Much harder to kill. You can stand between enemies and squishier allies, taking hits that would drop others.

### Weapon Specialist

If you want reliable damage with your signature weapon, this build focuses on your primary combat tool:

1. **Weapon Technique** (special maneuver with your weapon type)
2. **Precise Strike** (reroll damage die)
3. Later milestones: weapon mastery chain if continuing to specialize

**Result:** Consistent, reliable damage output. You know your weapon intimately and use it to maximum effect.

### Momentum Master

If you use techniques or spells frequently, this build expands your resource pool:

1. **Momentum Harmony** (+1 max Momentum)
2. **Momentum Harmony** (+1 more max Momentum, total +2)
3. **Momentum Harmony** (+1 more max Momentum, total +3)

**Result:** More Momentum to spend on techniques, spells, and abilities. You can use powerful options more frequently.

### Versatile Specialist

If you want to excel in specific situations rather than general capability:

1. **Skill Specialization:** Stealth (Urban environments)
2. **Skill Specialization:** Combat (Dueling)
3. **Skill Specialization:** Empathy (Reading lies)

**Result:** Exceptionally good in your specialty areas. When your situation matches your specialization, you're among the best.

### Adaptable Fighter

If you want tactical flexibility and the ability to handle varied situations:

1. **Armor Adaptation** (reduce armor penalty for specific action)
2. **Combat Style** (+1 to specific combat situation)
3. **Quick Draw** (switch weapons free)

**Result:** You adapt to different tactical situations. Where specialists might struggle outside their niche, you have options.

## Edge Stacking Rules

Some edges can be taken multiple times, while others provide their benefit once and can't be repeated.

### Edges That Stack

These edges can be taken multiple times, subject to the limits shown:

- **Weapon Technique** - One per weapon type
- **Armor Adaptation** - One per armor type
- **Tough** - Maximum 2 times total (total +4 Guard)
- **Hardy** - Maximum 2 times total (total +4 Vitality)
- **Momentum Harmony** - Maximum 3 times total (total +3 max Momentum)
- **Skill Specialization** - Multiple allowed as long as applications differ

### Edges That Don't Stack

These edges provide their benefit once. Taking them again has no effect:

- Quick Draw
- Combat Reflexes
- Fast Movement
- Precise Strike
- Defensive Fighter

## Game Master Guidance

### Awarding Edges at Minor Milestones

When players reach minor milestones, they choose between taking an edge or advancing a skill/attribute. Don't force players to take edges if they'd prefer advancement—the choice itself is part of character building.

That said, encourage variety over optimization. A character with diverse edges is often more fun to play than one min-maxed for a single strategy.

### Edges as Roleplay Rewards

Not all edges need to cost milestones. Social edges can emerge naturally from play:

- **Reputation** (+1 with specific group) earned through consistent actions
- **Contact** (ally in specific location) developed through interaction
- **Language** learned through extended exposure or dedicated study

When players earn these through roleplay, it reinforces the connection between their actions and their character sheet.

### Edges as Quest Rewards

Unique edges tied to story beats feel special and memorable:

- **Heirloom Weapon:** A family blade gains minor magical properties
- **Masterwork Tools:** Expert crafted tools provide +1 to craft/profession
- **Lucky Charm:** A token from a grateful NPC allows rerolling one die per scene

Make these feel earned through the story, not randomly distributed.

---

## Creating Custom Edges

Game Masters can create campaign-specific edges using these power level guidelines:

**Appropriate Power Levels:**
- +1 to a specific narrow application
- +2 to a very specific, limited-use situation
- Reroll one die in a particular circumstance
- Narrative permission for a unique action

**Example Custom Edge:**

> **Shadow Step**
>
> **Effect:** Once per scene, you can teleport to any shadow you can see within Near range
>
> **Requirement:** Stealth Professional (+1) or higher
>
> **Limit:** Once only

When creating custom edges, ensure they're comparable in power to existing edges. The goal is variety in character options, not power creep.

---

## Balance Considerations for GMs

All edges should meet these criteria:

- Comparable in power to +1 skill tier in a specific situation
- Useful but not mandatory for any character concept
- Create variety and specialization, not raw power increase
- Support the character concept rather than define it

### Watch For These Issues

- **Too many defensive edges:** Limit Tough and Hardy to 2 each maximum
- **Only combat edges:** Encourage variety across different aspects of play
- **Edges that obsolete skills:** An edge shouldn't make a skill pointless
- **Overpowered combinations:** Some edge combinations might create unintended synergies

When in doubt, remember that edges represent focused expertise, not sweeping power increases.

*Two fighters with identical skills can play completely differently through their edge selections. These small choices accumulate over a campaign to create unique characters.*
