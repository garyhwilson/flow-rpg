# Combat Techniques

Beyond basic weapon swings and defensive maneuvers lie the combat techniques—special tactical capabilities that transform capable fighters into legendary warriors. These aren't spells or magical abilities. They're refined applications of martial skill, tactical awareness, and combat experience made mechanical.

{{ techniques.acquisition.philosophy }}

**How You Learn Them:** Techniques are acquired by spending advances (earned through XP). Each technique costs 1 advance.

**Training Approach:** {{ techniques.acquisition.training }}

Unlike spells which require specific attributes and archetypes, combat techniques are available to everyone. Wizards can learn Devastating Blow. Rogues can master Perfect Parry. Your archetype shapes your starting capabilities, but techniques let you expand beyond those boundaries.

## Basic Techniques

**Available to:** All characters from the start
**Cost:** No Momentum required

These fundamental combat actions are available to every character from the beginning:

{% for technique in techniques.basic_techniques.no_momentum_cost %}
- {{ technique }}
{% endfor %}

You don't learn these—they're inherent to combat-trained characters. Use them freely to adapt to tactical situations.

---

## Novice Techniques

**Requirement:** Available at Novice rank (0-3 advances)

From your first advance, you can begin learning these techniques. They provide reliable tactical options that enhance your combat effectiveness without requiring significant Momentum investment:

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.novice_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}

### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if tech.trigger %}*{{ tech.trigger }}*{% endif %}

{{ tech.effect }}

{% if tech.cost %}**Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}**Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Novice techniques form your combat foundation. Choose 1-2 that complement your fighting style—defensive fighters favor Defensive Mastery, aggressive strikers prefer Press Advantage, opportunistic combatants like Riposte.

---

## Seasoned Techniques

**Requirement:** Requires Seasoned rank (4+ advances)

These powerful techniques require significant Momentum investment but can swing combat decisively. Available after reaching Seasoned rank:

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.seasoned_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}

### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{{ tech.effect }}

{% if tech.cost %}**Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.damage %}**Damage:** {{ tech.damage }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.timing %}**Timing:** {{ tech.timing }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}**Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Seasoned techniques represent your character's mastery of combat beyond basic competence. You'll typically use these 1-2 times per fight when you've built sufficient Momentum and need to change the tactical situation dramatically.

---

## Heroic Techniques

**Requirement:** Requires Heroic rank (12+ advances)

Ultimate combat abilities reserved for legendary warriors. These techniques deliver devastating results but require maximum Momentum:

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.heroic_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}

### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{{ tech.effect }}

{% if tech.cost %}**Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.damage %}**Damage:** {{ tech.damage }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.save %}**Save:** {{ tech.save }}{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}**Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Heroic techniques are combat-defining moments. When you've built maximum Momentum and need to end a fight decisively, these abilities deliver. Use them sparingly—saving them for critical moments creates dramatic tension.

## Building Your Technique Arsenal

### By Combat Role

**Defensive Fighter:**
Build toward survivability and control. Start with Defensive Mastery for enhanced Guard in Defensive stance. Add Perfect Parry at Seasoned rank to negate big hits entirely. Finish with Battlefield Control to dominate positioning.

**Aggressive Striker:**
Maximize damage output. Press Advantage provides passive bonus damage whenever you're at positive Momentum. Riposte adds extra attacks when enemies miss you. Devastating Blow delivers massive damage spikes. Unstoppable Assault ensures your finishing blow can't miss.

**Tactical Versatile:**
Create options for varied situations. Combat Momentum generates extra resources from critical successes. Quick Recovery maintains sustainability. Whirlwind Strike handles multiple opponents. Mix techniques that solve different tactical problems rather than specializing in one approach.

### Managing Momentum for Techniques

Your Momentum economy determines which techniques you can afford:

**Low Momentum (Below 0):** Use only basic techniques and focus on Momentum generation. Expensive techniques aren't accessible yet. Build resources before attempting power moves.

**Medium Momentum (0-3):** Novice techniques become available. Press Advantage activates passively. Riposte triggers on enemy misses. You're operating at base competence with occasional tactical flourishes.

**High Momentum (3-6):** Seasoned techniques unlock. Whirlwind Strike handles multiple enemies. Perfect Parry provides emergency defense. Devastating Blow delivers damage spikes. This is your optimal operating range.

**Maximum Momentum (6+):** Heroic techniques become possible. These should be saved for critical moments—turning desperate situations or finishing major threats. Don't waste Unstoppable Assault or Death Blow on trivial enemies.

### Technique Combinations

Different techniques synergize when combined thoughtfully:

**Momentum Engine:** Defensive Mastery (build Momentum safely) → Combat Momentum (bonus Momentum from crits) → Spend on spells or other techniques

**Aggressive Combo:** Press Advantage (passive damage) → Build Momentum through attacks → Devastating Blow (massive spike) → Unstoppable Assault (finish)

**Defensive Wall:** Defensive Mastery (+3 Guard) → Perfect Parry (negate hits) → Quick Recovery (sustain) → Battlefield Control (control field)

The key is choosing techniques that work together rather than randomly selecting powerful-sounding options.

## Game Master Guidance

### Teaching Techniques

Don't overcomplicate technique acquisition. When players spend advances on techniques, let them choose from rank-appropriate options. You can flavor this as:
- Self-discovery through combat experience
- Training montages during downtime
- Learning from defeated enemies
- Ancient tomes or master teachers

But don't require extensive downtime, specific trainers, or gold payments. Techniques are advance rewards—make them feel rewarding, not bureaucratic.

### Balancing Combat with Techniques

Expect players with techniques to be roughly 20% more effective in combat than baseline:
- Novice techniques add reliable tactical options
- Seasoned techniques create momentum swings
- Heroic techniques deliver climactic moments

Adjust encounter difficulty accordingly, but don't punish players for mastering techniques. If someone invests advances in combat techniques, they should feel powerful in combat.

### Technique Limitations

Techniques can't:
- Replace archetype features entirely
- Bypass core combat mechanics
- Scale infinitely with rank
- Function without Momentum (except basic techniques and certain passives)

Keep techniques powerful within their niche while maintaining overall game balance. A fighter with Unstoppable Assault is formidable but not invincible.

### Common Questions

**Can I use multiple techniques per turn?**
Yes, if you have the Momentum and actions. Most techniques cost Momentum but not actions, letting you combine them creatively.

**Do techniques work with spells?**
Yes. Devastating Blow can enhance spell attack damage just as easily as weapon damage.

**Can non-martial characters learn combat techniques?**
Absolutely. Wizards, clerics, and rogues can all learn combat techniques. No archetype restrictions exist.

**What about custom techniques?**
Work with players to create balanced custom techniques using existing ones as templates. Keep power levels comparable to the rank they'd be learned at.
