# COMBAT TECHNIQUES - ABILITY REFERENCE
*Generated from YAML source data*

## Overview

Combat techniques are special maneuvers and abilities learned through milestone advancement. Unlike spells, techniques are available to all character types and have no attribute requirements.

**Philosophy:** {{ techniques.acquisition.philosophy }}
**Acquisition:** {{ techniques.acquisition.method }}
**Training:** {{ techniques.acquisition.training }}

## Basic Techniques

**Available To:** {{ techniques.basic_techniques.available_to }}
**Cost:** No Flow cost

These are the fundamental combat actions available to everyone:

{% for technique in techniques.basic_techniques.no_flow_cost %}
- **{{ technique }}**
{% endfor %}

---

## Minor Milestone Techniques

**Requirement:** {{ techniques.minor_milestone_techniques.requirement }}

Learn these techniques after achieving your first minor milestone. They provide reliable tactical options that enhance your combat effectiveness.

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.minor_milestone_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}
### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{% if tech.trigger %}
- **Trigger:** {{ tech.trigger }}
{% endif %}
- **Effect:** {{ tech.effect }}
{% if tech.cost %}
- **Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}
- **Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

---

## Moderate Milestone Techniques

**Requirement:** {{ techniques.moderate_milestone_techniques.requirement }}

These powerful techniques require significant Flow investment but can turn the tide of battle. Available after moderate milestones.

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.moderate_milestone_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}
### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

- **Effect:** {{ tech.effect }}
{% if tech.cost %}
- **Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.damage %}
- **Damage:** {{ tech.damage }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.timing %}
- **Timing:** {{ tech.timing }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}
- **Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

---

## Major Milestone Techniques

**Requirement:** {{ techniques.major_milestone_techniques.requirement }}

Ultimate combat abilities that require maximum Flow but deliver devastating results. Reserved for legendary warriors.

{% for tech_id, tech in techniques.major_milestone_techniques.items() %}
{% if tech_id != 'requirement' %}
### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

- **Effect:** {{ tech.effect }}
{% if tech.cost %}
- **Cost:** {{ tech.cost }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.damage %}
- **Damage:** {{ tech.damage }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.save %}
- **Save:** {{ tech.save }}
{% endif %}
{% if tech.limit %}
- **Limit:** {{ tech.limit }}
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Technique Selection Strategy

### Building Your Technique Arsenal

**Early Game (Minor Milestones):**
- Choose 1-2 techniques that complement your playstyle
- Riposte for defensive fighters
- Press Advantage for aggressive damage dealers
- Defensive Mastery for defensive fighters
- Quick Recovery for sustainability

**Mid Game (Moderate Milestones):**
- Add powerful Flow-consuming techniques
- Whirlwind Strike for multi-target situations
- Perfect Parry for survival
- Devastating Blow for powerful adversaries
- Combat Flow for Flow generation

**Late Game (Major Milestones):**
- Select ultimate abilities carefully
- Unstoppable Assault for guaranteed damage
- Death Blow for finishing powerful enemies
- Battlefield Control for tactical domination

### Technique Combinations

**Defensive Fighter Build:**
1. Defensive Mastery (Minor) - +3 defense in Defensive stance
2. Perfect Parry (Moderate) - Negate damage
3. Combat Flow (Moderate) - Extra Flow generation
4. Battlefield Control (Major) - Control positioning

**Aggressive Striker Build:**
1. Press Advantage (Minor) - Bonus damage at positive Flow
2. Riposte (Minor) - Extra attacks
3. Devastating Blow (Moderate) - Maximum damage spike
4. Unstoppable Assault (Major) - Cannot miss

**Flow Engine Build:**
1. Combat Flow (Moderate) - Extra Flow on crits
2. Quick Recovery (Minor) - Sustainability
3. Defensive Mastery (Minor) - Safe Flow building
4. Use Flow for spells or other techniques

### Technique and Stance Synergy

**Aggressive Stance:**
- Press Advantage (passive damage while positive Flow)
- Devastating Blow (spend built-up Flow for massive hit)
- Unstoppable Assault (finish fights decisively)

**Balanced Stance:**
- Combat Flow (benefit from critical-focused play)
- Riposte (react to enemy attacks)
- Perfect Parry (tactical defense option)

**Defensive Stance:**
- Defensive Mastery (+3 total defense bonus)
- Quick Recovery (sustainability in long fights)
- Battlefield Control (control from safety)

### Flow Management with Techniques

**Low Flow (<0):**
- Use basic techniques only
- Focus on Flow generation
- Avoid expensive techniques

**Medium Flow (0-3):**
- Use minor milestone techniques
- Build toward moderate techniques
- Riposte and Press Advantage active

**High Flow (3-6):**
- Moderate milestone techniques available
- Whirlwind Strike for multi-target
- Perfect Parry for safety
- Devastating Blow for damage spike

**Maximum Flow (6+):**
- Major milestone techniques unlocked
- Save for critical moments
- Game-changing abilities
- Combat-ending moves

## GM Guidelines for Techniques

### Teaching Techniques

**Acquisition Methods:**
- Automatic at milestones (player choice)
- Training montages during downtime
- Learning from defeated enemies
- Ancient tomes or master teachers

**Don't require:**
- Specific trainers for every technique
- Extensive downtime
- Gold payment
- Attribute minimums

### Balancing Techniques in Combat

**Minor Techniques:**
- Used frequently (every combat)
- Low Flow cost sustainable
- Enhance but don't dominate

**Moderate Techniques:**
- Used 1-2 times per combat
- Require Flow buildup
- Swing momentum
- Feel powerful

**Major Techniques:**
- Used once per combat at most
- Require maximum Flow
- Should feel epic
- Combat-defining moments

### Scene Design

**For parties with techniques:**
- Expect ~20% more damage output
- Perfect Parry can negate big hits
- Whirlwind Strike changes multi-enemy math
- Death Blow threatens lone powerful adversaries

**GM options:**
- Reinforcements prevent major technique spam
- Flow draining effects limit options
- Spread adversaries to reduce Whirlwind value
- High Vitality opponents resist Death Blow

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use multiple techniques per turn?**
A: Yes, if you have the Flow and actions. Most cost Flow but not actions.

**Q: Do techniques stack with spells?**
A: Yes. Devastating Blow can be used with weapon or spell attacks.

**Q: Can rogues/wizards learn combat techniques?**
A: Yes! No class restrictions. Anyone can learn any technique.

**Q: What if I want a custom technique?**
A: Work with GM to create balanced custom techniques using existing ones as templates.

**Q: Can I unlearn techniques?**
A: Generally no, but GM may allow retraining during downtime.

### Technique Limitations

**What techniques can't do:**
- Replace class features entirely
- Bypass core mechanics
- Scale infinitely
- Work without Flow (except basics and passives)

**Design boundaries:**
- Moderate techniques shouldn't obsolete minor ones
- Major techniques should be rare in use
- Flow cost gates power level
- Techniques complement, don't replace, basic combat
