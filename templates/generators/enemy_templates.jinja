# ADVERSARY CREATION GUIDE
*Generated from YAML source data*

## The Red Cloak Gang

Street thugs working for crime lord Vex. They're in it for money, not loyalty—they'll flee if things turn badly. Led by a tough named Scarface who keeps them in line.

**Stats:**
- Gang members: Guard 10, Vitality 8, Damage 1d6+1, Professional Intimidate or Streetwise
- Scarface (leader): Guard 13, Vitality 12, Damage 1d6+2, Professional Intimidate and Combat
- Morale: Scatter if Scarface falls or 3+ gang members drop

*Street gangs typically have Guard 8-12 for regular thugs, with leaders slightly tougher at Guard 12-15.*

**What This Shows:** Gang members can take 2 hits before dropping. Scarface is tougher but still mortal. They're dangerous in groups but individually manageable.

## Inquisitor Thrace

Hunts heretics with zealous devotion. She genuinely believes she's saving souls. Methodical, uses holy magic, and offers mercy to those who recant. Escapes if defeated to return as recurring nemesis.

**Stats:**
- Guard: 48, Vitality: 84, Damage: 2d6+8
- Skills: Expert Theology and Insight, Professional Persuade
- Flow: Starts at +2
- Special: 3 actions/round (MAXIMUM 2 attacks), DR 2, 3 legendary resistances
- Tactics: Uses 3rd action for holy techniques, tries to convert PCs mid-combat
- Personality: Calm, disappointed when PCs refuse redemption, quotes scripture

*Inquisitors like Thrace typically have Guard 40-50 and Vitality 70-90, depending on their experience and divine favor.*

**What This Shows:** A serious threat requiring party coordination. Survives 4-6 rounds under focus fire. Three actions with attack limit prevents overwhelming the party. Legendary resistances let her shrug off save-or-die effects.

---

## Duelist Kain Moretti

Hired sword protecting a noble. Has a code of honor—fights to first blood in duels, doesn't attack unconscious foes, accepts surrender. Prideful and can be goaded into single combat.

**Stats:**
- Guard: 22, Vitality: 30, Damage: 2d6+1
- Skills: Professional Combat and Insight
- Flow: Starts at 0
- Personality: Honorable, expects respect, announces attacks dramatically
- Weakness: Can be talked into duels, won't hurt bystanders

*Skilled duelists typically have Guard 18-24 and Vitality 24-35, depending on reputation and experience.*

**What This Shows:** Equal match for an individual hero. Lasts 2-3 rounds under focus fire, longer in solo duel. His honor creates tactical and social options beyond straight combat.

---

## The Ancient Stone Guardian

An ageless construct protecting a forgotten temple. No personality, no fear, no mercy. Just eternal duty.

**Stats:**
- Guard: 40, Vitality: 70, Damage: 2d6+2
- Skills: None (mindless)
- Flow: Starts at +2
- Special: DR 2 (stone hide), 3 legendary resistances, immune to mind effects
- Weakness: Slow (can be outmaneuvered), vulnerable to environmental hazards

*Ancient constructs like this one are legendary threats—Guard 35-50, Vitality 60-80 depending on age and enchantment.*

**What This Shows:** Overwhelming for inexperienced heroes. Players must find clever solutions—lure it into traps, seal the door, negotiate with whatever controls it. Pure combat is possible but brutal.

---

## The Assassin in the Shadows

A killer hired to eliminate the party. Professional, emotionless, patient. Will retreat and try again if initial attempt fails.

**Stats:**
- Guard: 31 (deliberately low), Vitality: 39 (fragile), Damage: 2d6+8 (very high)
- Skills: Expert Stealth, Professional Combat and Poison
- Flow: Starts at +1
- Special: First strike from hiding (advantage + extra damage), can disengage and hide as single action
- Tactics: Hit hard, fade away, strike again. Never fights fair.

*Assassins trade durability for lethality. Most have Guard 25-35 and Vitality 30-45, but hit for 2d6+6 or more.*

**What This Shows:** Glass cannon. Deadly if she gets the drop on isolated targets. Vulnerable if caught in open combat. Creates paranoia and forces the party to watch their backs.

---

## The Corrupt Town Guard

Not evil, just greedy. They've been paid to look the other way. Most would rather take a bribe than risk their lives.

**Stats:**
- Individual guards: Guard 10, Vitality 8, Damage 1d6+1, Professional Combat
- Sergeant (their leader): Guard 13, Vitality 12, Damage 1d6+2, Professional Combat and Intimidate
- Morale: Extremely low. Will flee or surrender if offered better deal than their current bribe.

*Town guards typically have Guard 10-14 depending on training and equipment.*

**What This Shows:** Not all opposition requires violence. These guards can be intimidated, bribed, or convinced. The sergeant might turn on whoever paid him if the party offers more. Their corruption is a weakness.

---

## The Swarm of Rats

Hundreds of diseased rats flooding through the sewers. No tactics, no morale, just hunger and instinct.

**Stats:**
- Individual rats are irrelevant—treat entire swarm as single creature
- Guard: 10-15, Vitality: 40-60 (depending on swarm size)
- Damage: 1d6 to everyone in the zone
- Special: Area effects do double damage, swarm splits if reduced to half vitality

*Swarms scale with size. A cellar full of rats might have Vitality 40, while a city-spanning plague could have Vitality 80+.*

**What This Shows:** Area effects are the solution. Single-target damage is inefficient. Fire, explosions, and environmental hazards devastate swarms. Tactical terrain becomes crucial.

## Assigning Stats to Your Adversaries

Use these examples as models. Every significant adversary needs:

**A Name:** Even if it's just "Scarface the Enforcer"

**A Motivation:** Why are they here? What do they want?

**A Personality:** How does this affect their tactics and decisions?

**Stats Appropriate to Their Role:**

For **inexperienced or fragile** adversaries (new recruits, animals, desperate civilians):
- Guard: 8-14
- Vitality: 8-14
- Combat modifier: +0 to +1
- One Professional skill at most
- Flow: 0
- Falls in 2-3 hits

For **trained combatants** (professional soldiers, predators, skilled criminals):
- Guard: 14-20
- Vitality: 14-24
- Combat modifier: +2 to +3
- Two Professional skills
- Flow: 0-2
- Falls in 3-4 hits under focus fire

For **veterans and magical creatures** (experienced warriors, young dragons, vampire spawn):
- Guard: 20-32
- Vitality: 24-40
- Combat modifier: +3 to +4
- Two or three skills, some at Expert
- Flow: Starts at +2 to +4
- Falls in 2-3 rounds under focus fire

For **legendary threats** (ancient dragons, demon lords, archmages):
- Guard: 35-60
- Vitality: 40-70
- Combat modifier: +4 to +5
- Expert-level skills
- Flow: Starts at +4 to +6
- 3 actions/round (MAXIMUM 2 attacks), legendary resistances
- Creates 4-6 round conflicts

These are ranges, not formulas. Adjust for story and drama.

## Adjusting Stats for Story

### Narrative Importance

**Minor Threat:** Lower end of baseline, reduce Vitality
**Recurring Villain:** Higher Vitality, add escape options (teleport, hidden exits, loyal bodyguards)
**Climactic Adversary:** Upper end of baseline, add unique abilities

### Dramatic Needs

**Chase Scene:** High movement, lower Vitality (they should escape)
**Social Conflict:** High Presence/Mind, moderate combat stats
**Siege Defense:** Very high Vitality, lower damage (needs to survive prolonged fighting)
**Assassination Attempt:** Very high damage, low Vitality (glass cannon)

### Story Logic

**Ancient Guardian:** Very high Vitality (survived centuries)
**Hired Thugs:** Low loyalty (flee when hurt), respect strength
**Zealot Cultists:** Fight to death regardless of stats
**Corrupt Official:** High social skills, minimal combat ability

### Party Capabilities

**Party Has Healing:** Enemies can hit harder
**Party Focuses Single Target:** Add reinforcements or escape options
**Party Uses Area Effects:** Use fewer, tougher enemies
**Party Struggles with Saves:** Reduce enemy save-or-suck abilities

---

## Adjusting Conflicts During Play

### If Conflict Feels Too Easy

- Reinforcements arrive (makes narrative sense)
- Enemy reveals new capability (was holding back)
- Environmental complication (alarm triggers, ceiling collapses)
- Objective changes (villain escapes with the artifact)

### If Conflict Feels Too Hard

- NPC ally arrives (someone who'd realistically help)
- Enemy offers terms (most people prefer living)
- Environmental opportunity (escape route, environmental weapon)
- Reveal weakness (ancient armor has a crack)

Adjust for story and drama. The goal is memorable narrative, not mathematical precision.

## Important Details

**Every significant adversary should have:**
- A name (even if it's just "Scarface the Enforcer")
- A motivation (why are they here, what do they want?)
- A personality trait (affects their tactics and decisions)
- Stats appropriate to their narrative role

**Consider:**
- How do they react when hurt?
- What are they willing to die for?
- Who do they care about?
- What do they fear?

These details make adversaries memorable and give players meaningful choices beyond "attack until dead."

*Stats serve the story. Start with who the character is, then assign numbers that match their narrative role.*
