# Legendary Techniques

Heroes master advanced techniques. Legends transcend them. Legendary techniques represent the absolute pinnacle of mortal capability—abilities so powerful they reshape battles, bend reality, or accomplish the impossible. These aren't just enhanced versions of normal abilities. They're campaign-defining powers that create moments players remember years later.

Legendary techniques become available at Legendary rank (16+ advances, typically sessions 33+). They require Momentum +6 to activate—a threshold so high that using them demands extended success sequences or climactic moments when everything hangs in balance. When you unleash a legendary technique, it should feel like the pivotal moment of the entire session.

## Understanding Legendary Techniques

### Momentum Requirement: +6

Legendary techniques activate only at Momentum +6 or higher. This extreme requirement creates dramatic pacing:

**Extended Success:** Reaching +6 Momentum requires sustained excellence—multiple successful attacks, critical hits, or perfect defensive sequences.

**Team Coordination:** Allies can grant Momentum through support actions, enabling legendary technique activation through party coordination.

**Climactic Timing:** Momentum +6 typically arrives late in major battles, ensuring legendary techniques resolve climactic encounters rather than opening with them.

You can't casually activate legendary techniques. They emerge from desperate final stands, overwhelming victories, or perfectly executed battle plans.

### Rank-Based Acquisition

You gain legendary techniques by spending advances at Legendary rank:

- **Heroic (12-15 advances):** Some precursor techniques become available, preparing for legendary power
- **Legendary (16+ advances):** Full legendary techniques unlock, marking transition to mythic power

Most campaigns feature 2-3 legendary techniques total across entire party. Choose the one that defines your character's ultimate capability.

### Once-Per-Session Power

Even with Momentum +6, legendary techniques typically limit to once per session or once per major encounter. The Momentum cost alone prevents spamming, but additional limits ensure they remain special rather than routine.

Game Masters should enforce: "You've used Unstoppable Assault this fight. It won't be available again until your next major confrontation."

## Combat Techniques

{% if advancement_data.combat_techniques.legendary_techniques %}
Legendary combat techniques end fights definitively. When activated, battles shift from uncertain to inevitable.

{% for tech_id, tech in advancement_data.combat_techniques.legendary_techniques.items() %}
### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{{ tech.effect }}

**Requirement:** Momentum {{ tech.momentum_cost if tech.momentum_cost else '+6' }}
**Type:** Legendary Combat Technique
**Frequency:** Once per major encounter

**When to Use:** {% if 'extra action' in tech.effect|lower %}Take an additional action every round, doubling your combat effectiveness. Use when facing multiple threats or when sheer volume of attacks will turn the tide.{% elif 'flee' in tech.effect|lower or 'presence' in tech.effect|lower %}Force enemies to flee through sheer force of presence. Use when outnumbered or when you need to protect wounded allies by scattering threats.{% elif 'advantage' in tech.effect|lower or 'mastery' in tech.effect|lower %}Perfect combat execution—every attack, every defense, every maneuver executed flawlessly. Use when you need absolute reliability against the deadliest foes.{% else %}Ultimate combat power requiring Momentum +6. Activating this determines battle outcomes.{% endif %}

**Legendary Moment Example:** {% if 'extra action' in tech.effect|lower %}"The demon horde presses in from all sides. Your allies are overwhelmed. You tap into reserves beyond mortal limits—Army of One activates. Your blade is everywhere at once, cutting down enemies faster than they can react. What should have been your last stand becomes their massacre."{% elif 'flee' in tech.effect|lower %}"The enemy army surrounds your wounded companions. You step forward, channeling every ounce of accumulated Momentum. Your presence becomes overwhelming—Legendary Presence activates. Even the bravest warriors turn and flee. You stand alone in the center of an empty battlefield."{% elif 'mastery' in tech.effect|lower %}"Facing the ancient dragon, you clear your mind. Transcendent Mastery activates—your movements become perfect, your strikes inevitable, your defenses impenetrable. For this fight, you are not merely skilled. You are perfection incarnate."{% else %}"This is the moment that defines legends."{% endif %}

## Magic Techniques

{% if advancement_data.magic_techniques and advancement_data.magic_techniques.legendary_metamagic %}
Legendary magic techniques shatter fundamental rules of spellcasting. These abilities accomplish what normal magic cannot.

{% for tech_id, tech in advancement_data.magic_techniques.legendary_metamagic.items() %}
### {{ tech_id.replace('_', ' ').title() }}

{{ tech.effect }}

**Additional Cost:** {{ tech.additional_cost if tech.additional_cost else '+6 Momentum' }}
**Type:** Legendary Magic Technique (Metamagic)
**Frequency:** Once per major encounter

**When to Use:** {% if 'ignore' in tech.effect|lower and 'rule' in tech.effect|lower %}Break fundamental magical limitations when standard casting fails. Cast Wish without backlash, Fireball in anti-magic field, healing spell at impossible range. Reality Break lets magic work when it shouldn't.{% elif 'permanent' in tech.effect|lower %}Make temporary magic eternal. Permanent flight, permanent mind reading, permanent invisibility. The ultimate magical achievement—making fleeting effects last forever.{% else %}Reality-altering magical power requiring extreme Momentum. Activating this rewrites magical rules.{% endif %}

**Legendary Moment Example:** {% if 'reality break' in tech_id|lower or 'ignore' in tech.effect|lower %}"The demon's anti-magic aura nullifies all spells. Your party stands helpless as it advances. You gather every scrap of Momentum, force your will against reality itself—Reality Break activates. For one impossible moment, magic works in the dead zone. Your Banishment spell tears the demon back to the Abyss despite impossible odds."{% elif 'permanent' in tech_id|lower %}"The dragon's curse: flight only lasts minutes before failing. You've gathered enough Momentum through the entire campaign. Now, atop the dragon's corpse, you channel everything into one final working. Permanent Effect activates—your wings are yours forever."{% else %}"This is magic that reshapes reality."{% endif %}

## Choosing Your Legendary Technique

### Character Identity

Select legendary techniques that define who your character becomes:

**The Unstoppable Warrior:** Unstoppable Assault or Death Blow completes your evolution into perfect combatant

**The Reality-Warping Mage:** Reality Break or Dual Casting cements your status as archmage who reshapes existence

**The Impossible Achiever:** Impossible Task or Perfect Knowledge makes you the one who succeeds where others cannot

Legendary techniques aren't just mechanical choices—they're narrative statements about your character's ultimate capability.

### Party Needs

Consider what the party lacks:

**Need finishing power?** Death Blow or Unstoppable Assault eliminates tough enemies
**Need magical flexibility?** Dual Casting or Reality Break solves impossible magical problems
**Need coordination?** Inspire Legend makes entire party legendary temporarily
**Need battlefield control?** Battlefield Control reshapes combat fundamentally

Don't duplicate legendary techniques across party. Coordinate so each member contributes unique legendary capability.

### Campaign Context

Choose techniques suited to your campaign's challenges:

**Combat-heavy campaigns:** Combat legendary techniques see frequent use
**Intrigue campaigns:** Skill legendary techniques solve impossible social/information challenges
**Mixed campaigns:** Magic legendary techniques provide versatility

Legendary techniques used rarely feel wasted. Select techniques you'll actually activate.

## Using Legendary Techniques

### Building to Momentum +6

Reaching +6 Momentum requires sustained success:

**Aggressive Stance:** 6 successful attacks (generates +1 per hit)
**Balanced Stance:** 6 excellent rolls of 10+ (generates +1 per excellence)
**Defensive Stance:** Being attacked 6 times (generates +1 per targeting)

Alternatively, combine Momentum generation with Momentum preservation—generate +3, spend none, generate +3 more.

Party coordination accelerates: allies grant Momentum through support actions, healing, or buffs.

### Maximizing Impact

Legendary techniques should resolve situations, not just contribute:

**Don't waste on minor enemies:** Save for climactic confrontations
**Don't activate early:** Build to +6 later in fight when enemies worn down
**Don't use without setup:** Coordinate party to maximize legendary technique impact

When you activate legendary technique, it should feel like the moment the battle turned.

### Narrative Weight

Legendary techniques deserve description:

*"Standard attack":* "You hit for 15 damage."

*"Legendary technique":* "You've built Momentum through perfect combat—each successful strike accumulates power crackling around you. Now facing the dragon at last, you channel everything into single perfect strike. Unstoppable Assault activates—reality itself cannot prevent your blade from finding the dragon's heart. Maximum damage, perfect accuracy, the impossible made inevitable."

Game Masters should encourage players to describe legendary technique activations dramatically.

## Game Master Guidance

### Balancing Legendary Techniques

Legendary techniques should feel overwhelming without trivializing campaigns:

**Appropriate situations:** Decide major encounters but don't auto-win campaigns
**Momentum requirement:** +6 threshold ensures rare activation
**Frequency limits:** Once per major encounter prevents spamming
**Saves still apply:** Some legendary techniques allow saves—they're powerful, not unstoppable

If legendary techniques dominate too much, increase frequency limits (once per session). If underwhelming, reduce Momentum cost to +5.

### Creating Legendary Moments

Design encounters that enable legendary technique use:

**Major confrontations lasting 5+ rounds:** Give time to build +6 Momentum
**Multiple-phase encounters:** Reset between phases, allowing legendary technique per phase
**Desperate circumstances:** Create situations where legendary techniques feel justified

Telegraph when enemies prepare legendary-tier abilities: "The lich begins weaving reality-rending magic—you sense this will be devastating."

### NPC Legendary Techniques

Major villains should have legendary techniques:

**Campaign villains:** 1-2 legendary techniques used at critical thresholds
**Ancient dragons:** Reality-shaping legendary breath weapons
**Demon lords:** Hell-breaking legendary summonings

When NPCs use legendary techniques, describe them dramatically and give players moments to react before activation completes.

*Legendary techniques represent the apex of mortal achievement. Choose wisely, build Momentum patiently, and unleash them at moments when legends are born.*
