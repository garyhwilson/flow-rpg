# Advanced Techniques

Basic techniques define competent adventurers. Anyone can swing a sword, cast a cantrip, or make a skill check. But advanced techniques—the devastating combos, impossible maneuvers, and reality-bending abilities that require significant Momentum investment—separate heroes from legends.

Advanced techniques become available at moderate milestones (typically sessions 3, 6, and 9). They require Momentum +3 to activate, meaning you must build Momentum reserves through successful actions before unleashing them. This requirement ensures advanced techniques feel climactic rather than routine—you don't spam them every turn, you build toward dramatic moments when they matter most.

## Understanding Advanced Techniques

### Momentum Requirement: +3

Advanced techniques activate only when you've accumulated +3 Momentum or higher. This creates natural pacing:

**Build Phase:** Generate Momentum through successful attacks, excellent rolls, or stance-specific triggers
**Activation Window:** Once you reach +3 Momentum, advanced techniques become available
**Decision Point:** Spend Momentum on advanced technique now, or save for even more powerful options later?

The Momentum requirement means advanced techniques emerge from success, not desperation. You can't use them when losing badly—you must be winning enough to have built Momentum reserves.

### Moderate Milestone Acquisition

You gain advanced techniques at moderate milestones—sessions 3, 6, and 9 in typical campaigns. This timing means:

- **Session 3:** Your first advanced technique defines your mid-campaign identity
- **Session 6:** Second technique expands your tactical options
- **Session 9:** Third technique completes your advanced arsenal before legendary powers arrive

Choose techniques that complement your build and fill gaps in your capabilities.

## Using Advanced Techniques Effectively

### Building Momentum for Activation

Advanced techniques require +3 Momentum, which you accumulate through:

**Aggressive Stance:** Generate +1 Momentum per successful attack. Three hits builds enough Momentum.

**Balanced Stance:** Generate +1 Momentum on rolls of 10+. Consistent excellence builds reserves.

**Defensive Stance:** Generate +1 Momentum when attacked. Being targeted builds activation opportunities.

Plan several turns ahead. Don't spend Momentum carelessly on minor techniques when advanced technique activation is close.

### Timing Your Activation

Advanced techniques feel climactic when used at critical moments:

**Turn the tide:** Activate when combat shifts against you—Whirlwind Strike eliminates surrounding enemies, Perfect Parry negates devastating attack.

**Finish fights:** Activate when enemies cluster or priority targets expose themselves—Devastating Blow ends climactic encounters.

**Enable combos:** Activate to set up party coordination—skill mastery succeeds at crucial check, team coordination empowers entire party.

Don't waste advanced techniques on trivial encounters. Save them for moments that matter.

### Choosing Which Techniques to Learn

At moderate milestones, select techniques that:

**Fill capability gaps:** Combat specialists take skill techniques for versatility. Wizards take combat techniques for survival.

**Enhance existing strengths:** Fighters double down on combat devastation. Skill experts guarantee critical successes.

**Enable signature strategies:** Build around specific playstyles—area specialists take Whirlwind Strike, defense experts take Perfect Parry.

You'll learn 3-4 advanced techniques across typical campaigns. Choose carefully—each represents major milestone investment.

### Combining with Other Techniques

Advanced techniques work alongside basic techniques and class abilities:

**Layer effects:** Perfect Parry (advanced) + Riposte (basic) = negate attack then counterattack
**Sequence actions:** Whirlwind Strike (advanced) hits all enemies, generate Momentum, use basic techniques with new Momentum
**Multiply benefits:** Cast 2 Spells (advanced) + Metamagic (wizard feature) = two enhanced spells simultaneously

Advanced techniques are capstones, not replacements. Master basic techniques first, then add advanced options for tactical depth.

## Advanced Technique Synergies

### Combat Synergies

**Whirlwind Strike + Aggressive Stance:** Hit all adjacent enemies, generate massive Momentum from multiple hits, enable follow-up techniques.

**Perfect Parry + Defensive Stance:** Already generating Momentum when attacked, Perfect Parry ensures survival against overwhelming threats.

**Devastating Blow + Critical-focused build:** Double already-impressive critical damage, eliminate targets that survive normal attacks.

### Magic Synergies

**Metamagic Mastery + Wizard Features:** Stack wizard metamagic with advanced metamagic mastery for triple-enhanced spells.

**Spell Combo + Area Spells:** Cast Fireball + Lightning Bolt in single turn, devastate clustered enemies or multiple groups.

**Momentum Channeling + Desperate Situations:** Convert Vitality to Momentum when magical reserves depleted, continue casting when others would fail.

### Skill Synergies

**Skill Mastery + Critical Moments:** Automatically succeed at crucial skill checks—pick the lock as guards approach, persuade the king during tense negotiations.

**Team Coordination + Party Planning:** Grant entire party your expertise for coordinated skill challenges requiring multiple successes.

**Perfect Timing + Reactive Situations:** Act outside turn order to interrupt enemies, protect allies, or seize opportunities before they vanish.

## Game Master Guidance

### Balancing Advanced Techniques

Advanced techniques should feel powerful without dominating play:

**Appropriate power level:** Worth the Momentum +3 investment but not auto-win buttons

**Situational value:** Extremely strong in right circumstances, less overwhelming otherwise

**Resource cost:** Momentum requirement prevents spamming, ensures dramatic timing

**Build investment:** Moderate milestone opportunity cost means characters choose carefully

If advanced techniques feel too weak, reduce Momentum cost to +2. If too strong, increase to +4 or limit uses per scene.

### Encounter Design

Create encounters that reward advanced technique use:

**Multiple weak enemies:** Whirlwind Strike excels against clusters
**High-damage threats:** Perfect Parry shines against devastating single attacks
**Critical skill checks:** Skill Mastery matters when failure means disaster
**Complex magical problems:** Spell combinations solve what single spells cannot

Don't require advanced techniques to win—but do create situations where they excel.

### NPC Advanced Techniques

Adversaries can use advanced techniques too:

**Major villains:** Give significant antagonists 1-2 advanced techniques to create memorable fights
**Dangerous adversaries:** Grant powerful NPCs a signature advanced technique
**Rival adventurers:** NPC parties should mirror PC capabilities

When NPCs use advanced techniques, telegraph them:

"The warlord's eyes glow with battle-fury—he's building Momentum for something devastating."

Players appreciate knowing major abilities are coming and can plan counters.

### Milestone Timing

Advanced techniques arrive at moderate milestones (sessions 3, 6, 9 typically). This timing creates power spikes:

**Session 3:** First advanced technique makes PCs feel genuinely powerful
**Session 6:** Second technique expands tactical options significantly
**Session 9:** Third technique completes advanced arsenal before legendary abilities

If your campaign pacing differs, adjust milestone timing but maintain 3-session spacing between moderate milestones for consistent growth feel.

*Advanced techniques represent capabilities beyond normal mortal limits. Master Momentum generation to activate them reliably, choose techniques that complement your build, and unleash them at moments when they turn impossible situations into legendary victories.*
