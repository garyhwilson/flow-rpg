### The Revolutionary Magic System

Autumn Phoenix RPG's magic system breaks from tradition. Instead of giving each caster type unique spells, **the same spells adapt to your approach:**

- **Wizards** cast with **Mind** for precision and control
- **Sorcerers** cast with **Awareness** for raw power
- **Clerics** cast with **Will** for reliability
- **Bards** cast with **Presence** for social impact

**Same spell. Different story. Different tactics.**

This grimoire explores every spell in depth, showing how each approach creates unique effects and tactical opportunities.

### For Players and GMs

Whether you're a player building a spellcaster or a GM adjudicating magic, this grimoire provides the deep understanding you need to leverage the flexible system fully.
