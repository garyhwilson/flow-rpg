# PLAYING THE GAME

## Core Gameplay Loop

The game follows a consistent structure that balances player agency with GM guidance:

1. **GM Sets the Scene:** Describes environment, NPCs, and situation
2. **Players Declare Actions:** State what their characters attempt to do
3. **GM Determines Approach:** Assigns appropriate Attribute + Skill combination
4. **Players Roll Dice:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill vs target difficulty (typically 8)
5. **GM Narrates Results:** Describes outcome based on success level
6. **Momentum Adjusts:** Players gain or lose Momentum based on results
7. **Narrative Progresses:** Scene evolves based on character actions

This cycle repeats throughout gameplay, maintaining a balance between mechanical resolution and narrative development.

## Scenes & Encounters

### Scene Types

The game features four primary scene types, each with distinct pacing and focus:

#### Action Scenes

- Combat encounters, chases, time-pressure situations
- Turn-by-turn structure with stance-based initiative
- Heavy Momentum generation and expenditure
- Typically last 3-5 rounds of combat

#### Social Scenes

- Negotiations, interrogations, persuasion attempts
- Can use structured social combat or freeform roleplay
- Focus on character motivations and relationships
- Momentum generation through successful social maneuvers

#### Exploration Scenes

- Investigating locations, solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles
- Skill checks to discover information and overcome challenges
- Momentum generation through successful discoveries
- Environmental hazards and challenges

#### Downtime Scenes

- Rest, recovery, research, and personal projects
- Opportunity for character development
- Preparation for upcoming challenges
- Momentum resets to 0 after extended rest

### Scene Transitions

The GM indicates transitions between scene types by:

- **Setting Stakes:** "The guards spot you - what do you do?"
- **Changing Pace:** "As the dust settles from battle..."
- **Environmental Shift:** "The narrow passage opens into a vast chamber..."
- **Temporal Shift:** "After resting for the night..."

### Scene Resolution

A scene typically concludes when:

- The primary challenge is overcome
- The party achieves their immediate objective
- The situation fundamentally changes
- The party retreats or changes course

## Skill Challenge Framework

Complex tasks that require multiple successful checks can be structured as skill challenges:

### Designing Skill Challenges

1. **Define Objective:** What players are trying to accomplish
2. **Set Complexity:** Number of successful checks needed (typically 3-5)
3. **Identify Key Skills:** Primary skills that apply to the challenge
4. **Establish Consequences:** What happens on success/failure
5. **Allow Creative Approaches:** Different skill/attribute combinations

### Running Skill Challenges

- Players describe approach and make appropriate checks
- Each player should contribute different skills
- Success/failure advances narrative in different ways
- Momentum can be spent to enhance rolls
- Critical successes count as two successes

### Example Skill Challenge: Mountain Crossing

**Objective:** Cross treacherous mountain pass during a storm
**Complexity:** 4 successes before 3 failures
**Key Skills:** Athletics, Survival, Investigate
**Consequences:** Success = safe passage, Failure = dangerous detour
**Approaches:**

- Athletics (Might) to climb difficult sections
- Survival (Awareness) to find sheltered paths
- Investigate (Mind) to predict avalanche zones
- Command (Presence) to keep party motivated
- Medicine (Mind) to treat cold injuries

## Running the Game

### GM Principles

Effective Game Masters follow these core principles:

- When in doubt, choose the more interesting outcome
- Let player creativity flourish

**Fair But Challenging**

- Provide obstacles that test characters' abilities
- Scale challenges to character capabilities
- Allow both success and failure to be interesting

**Momentum Management**

- Monitor the Momentum economy to ensure balance
- Provide opportunities to gain and spend Momentum
- Use Momentum as pacing mechanism for scenes

**Collaborative Storytelling**

- Incorporate player ideas and backstories
- Build on player actions to develop the narrative
- Share narrative control where appropriate

### Creating Adventures

A well-designed adventure typically includes:

**Hook & Motivation**

- Opportunity for different strategies
- No single "correct" path through the adventure

**Rewards & Development**

- Appropriate treasure, information, or resources
- Opportunities for character growth
- Seeds for future adventures

### Adapting to Player Choices

When players take unexpected actions:

1. **Consider the Logic:** Does their approach make sense in the world?
2. **Determine Difficulty:** Set appropriate target numbers
3. **Identify Consequences:** What happens on success or failure?
4. **Integrate into Narrative:** How does this change the story?
5. **Move Forward:** Adapt the adventure to accommodate their choice

### Pacing Guidelines

Maintain engaging pacing with these techniques:

**Session Structure**

- Begin with a recap and character moment

- End with a satisfying conclusion or compelling cliffhanger

**Scene Transitions**

- Recognize when a scene has accomplished its purpose
- Use "meanwhile" cuts to maintain momentum
- Vary pacing between tense and relaxed scenes

**Time Management**

- Allocate time based on importance, not just challenge
- Handwave routine or repetitive actions
- Give more time to character-defining moments

## Advanced Gameplay Elements

### Group Checks

When the entire party attempts the same action:

- Everyone makes the appropriate check
- Success requires at least half the group to succeed
- Critical successes can offset failures
- Momentum can be spent to help struggling party members

### Opposed Checks

When characters directly compete:

- Both sides make appropriate checks
- Higher result wins (ties favor defenders)
- Margin of success determines outcome degree
- Momentum can be spent after seeing opponent's roll

### Helping & Hindering

Characters can assist or interfere with others:

- **Help:** Make same check, success gives +1d6 to primary character
- **Hinder:** Make opposed check, success gives -1d6 to target
- Limit of one help/hinder per action
- Requires logical explanation of assistance method

### Secret Checks

Some checks are made by the GM:

- When character wouldn't know if they succeeded
- When information should be uncertain
- When metagaming concerns exist
- Examples: Stealth, certain Investigate checks, some social insights
