The character sheet includes a dedicated Advancement Tracker section that allows players to:

1. Track XP earned toward the next advance (5 XP = 1 Advance)
2. Track total advances earned and current rank
3. Reference the five ranks: Novice → Seasoned → Veteran → Heroic → Legendary

This helps players track their character progression and know when rank promotions unlock new techniques and abilities.

## Design Notes

### Core Design Philosophy

This game system was designed with the following principles:

#### Elegance Over Complexity

- Simple, unified resolution system
- Minimal bookkeeping and calculation
- Deep decision space without excessive rules

#### Narrative-First with Tactical Depth

- Story drives mechanics, not vice versa
- Tactical options for those who want them
- Every rule supports the fiction

#### Momentum as Universal Resource

- Single resource unifying all subsystems
- Dynamic economy creating dramatic pacing
- Intuitive resource that mirrors character momentum

#### Player Agency

- Meaningful choices in character building
- Tactical decisions in combat
- Narrative permissions granting special capabilities

### Playtest Insights

Extensive playtesting revealed several key insights that shaped the final system:

#### What Worked Best

- Flexible magic system creates diverse casters
- Stance-based combat eliminates initiative bottleneck
- Momentum economy creates natural pacing
- The Three Pillars (Species/Archetype/Calling) create rich characters

#### Ongoing Balance Considerations

- Monitor Guard scaling at higher ranks
- Watch Halfling weapon damage penalty
- Observe Scholar Calling retroactive dice benefit
- Track Will casting as "emergency button"

#### The Magic of Unexpected Combinations

The most memorable characters came from unexpected combinations:

- Dwarf Wizard Exemplar (proving dwarves can master magic)
- Halfling Paladin Advocate (tiny crusader for justice)
- Elf Fighter Scholar (martial arts as academic study)
- Human Ranger Seeker (finding themselves in wilderness)

### Final Thoughts

This system aims to occupy the "rules-moderate" space between narrative games and tactical simulators. It provides enough mechanical crunch to satisfy strategic players while maintaining narrative flexibility for storytellers.

The Momentum system serves as the unifying element that bridges combat, magic, and social interactions into a cohesive whole. By making Momentum the central resource, all character actions feel connected to the same underlying game economy.

Most importantly, the system encourages players to create characters driven by internal motivation (Calling) as much as external capability (Species and Archetype). This three-dimensional approach creates richer roleplaying opportunities and more memorable heroes.
