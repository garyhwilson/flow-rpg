## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes narrative-first gameplay while offering tactical depth for those who want it. This system occupies the "rules-moderate" complexity space between narrative-light games and heavy tactical systems.

### The Three Pillars of Character

Every character in this game is defined by three core elements that work together to create a unique hero:

1. **SPECIES** - Your heritage and ancestry (What you ARE)
2. **ARCHETYPE** - Your training and profession (What you DO)
3. **CALLING** - Your inner drive and motivation (WHY you adventure)

This three-pillar approach creates 252 possible character combinations, each mechanically viable and narratively rich.

### What Makes This System Unique

**Momentum-Based Gameplay:** The Momentum system unifies combat, magic, and dramatic scenes through a single resource economy that rises and falls throughout each encounter.

**Stance-Based Combat:** No traditional initiative system - your tactical choices determine when you act through an elegant stance system that rewards positioning and strategy.

**Flexible Magic:** Cast the same spell in four different ways based on your approach, creating diverse casting styles without complex spell lists.

**Narrative Permissions:** Your Calling grants you special abilities that bypass normal rules, allowing your character's motivations to directly impact the world.

### Design Philosophy

This system is built on the following principles:

- **Elegance over complexity**
- **Perceived simplicity over dumb-simple**
- **Narrative-first with tactical depth option**
- **Momentum as central unifying mechanic**
- **Fail-forward built into resolution**
- **65% baseline success rate**
- **Rules-moderate** (less complex than D&D 5e)
