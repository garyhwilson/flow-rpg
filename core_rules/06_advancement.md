# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

## The Milestone System

This game uses milestone-based advancement instead of experience points. Milestones represent significant moments of character growth and development that occur naturally through the story.

### Philosophy Behind Milestones

- **Story-Driven Growth:** Characters advance when the narrative calls for it
- **No Bookkeeping:** No need to track XP or calculate advancement
- **GM Control:** The GM determines when milestones occur based on story pacing
- **Equal Advancement:** All characters reach milestones together

### Types of Milestones

There are three tiers of milestones, each representing a different magnitude of character development:

1. **Minor Milestones:** Small but meaningful growth (individual development)
2. **Moderate Milestones:** Substantial character development (group achievement)
3. **Major Milestones:** Transformative evolution (campaign-defining moments)

---

## Minor Milestones

Minor milestones occur frequently and represent individual character growth moments.

### When to Award Minor Milestones

- After completing a single session
- Upon resolving a challenging encounter
- When characters make a small but meaningful discovery
- After successful use of skills in a significant way
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 1-2 sessions

### Minor Milestone Options

Choose ONE of the following when you reach a minor milestone:

**Skill Development**
- Advance one skill up one tier (Untrained → Competent → Professional)
- Gain a new skill at Competent level
- Note: Cannot advance beyond Professional tier (+2) with minor milestones

**Attribute Adjustment**
- Adjust one attribute by +1/-1 (representing shift in focus or retraining)
- Total attribute points must remain the same
- Example: Lower Grace by -1 to raise Mind by +1

**Combat Technique**
- Learn a basic combat technique
- Options include:
  - Riposte: After successful Defend, immediately Strike
  - Press Advantage: +1d6 damage when Flow positive
  - Defensive Stance Mastery: Trade offense for stronger defense
  - Quick Recovery: Regain Guard between rounds

**Calling Exploration**
- Deepen understanding of current Calling
- Gain minor related benefit (GM discretion)
- Explore Calling through roleplay and narrative development

### Minor Milestone Example

*After successfully infiltrating the governor's mansion and discovering evidence of corruption, the party reaches a minor milestone.*

**Elena (Cleric)** chooses to adjust her attributes, lowering Presence by -1 to raise Awareness by +1, reflecting her growing perceptiveness to danger.

**Magnus (Fighter)** learns the Press Advantage combat technique, allowing him to deal +1d6 damage when his Flow is positive.

**Lyra (Wizard)** advances her Investigate skill from Competent (+0) to Professional (+2), having honed her analytical abilities during the mission.

### Appropriate Challenges After Minor Milestones

Characters who have experienced a few minor milestones are appropriate for:
- Local threats (bandits, wolves, minor undead)
- Small-scale local problems
- Threats to villages or small communities

## Signature Moves System

Signature Moves represent a character's unique fighting style or magical technique. They are created at moderate milestones and evolve as characters advance.

### Creating a Signature Move

**Core Components:**
1. **Mechanical Effect:** What the move does (damage, protection, etc.)
2. **Flow Cost:** Normally costs 1 less than standard (minimum 0)
3. **Thematic Element:** How it reflects your character

**Inspiration Sources:**
- Your Archetype's traditional techniques
- Your Calling's motivational focus
- Your Species' natural abilities
- Your personal character history

### Evolving Signature Moves

At each subsequent milestone, you can choose to evolve your Signature Move in one of three ways:

**Power Evolution:**
- Increase the move's magnitude
- Flow cost increases by 1

**Efficiency Evolution:**
- Reduce Flow cost by an additional 1 (minimum 0)
- Effect remains the same

**Versatility Evolution:**
- Add a secondary effect or option
- Flow cost may increase by 1 if significantly more powerful
