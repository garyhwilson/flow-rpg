# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

## The XP and Ranks System

Autumn Phoenix RPG uses a Savage Worlds-inspired advancement system. Characters earn Experience Points (XP) each session, which accumulate into Advances that let you grow your character.

### Core Mechanics

- **GM awards 3-5 XP per session** (average 4)
- **5 XP = 1 Advance**
- **4 Advances = 1 Rank promotion**
- **5 Ranks total:** Novice → Seasoned → Veteran → Heroic → Legendary

### Why This System?

- **Simple tracking:** Just count XP to 5, then spend an advance
- **Predictable progression:** You know roughly when you'll rank up
- **Player choice:** Every advance, YOU decide how to grow
- **Long campaigns:** Designed for 30-50 sessions to reach Legendary

## The Five Ranks

Your Rank represents your overall experience and power level. As you accumulate advances, you'll promote through the ranks.

| Rank | Advances Required | Typical Sessions |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Novice** | 0-3 advances | Sessions 1-8 |
| **Seasoned** | 4-7 advances | Sessions 9-16 |
| **Veteran** | 8-11 advances | Sessions 17-24 |
| **Heroic** | 12-15 advances | Sessions 25-32 |
| **Legendary** | 16+ advances | Sessions 33+ |

### Rank Descriptions

**Novice (0-3 Advances)**
New adventurers finding their footing. You're competent but still learning. Local threats like bandits and wild animals are appropriate challenges.

**Seasoned (4-7 Advances)**
Established heroes with growing reputations. You've proven yourself and are known in the region. Organized crime, cultists, and dangerous beasts are your foes.

**Veteran (8-11 Advances)**
Renowned champions at the peak of mortal capability. You've likely reached the +5 modifier cap in your primary skills. Noble houses, young dragons, and demon cults challenge you.

**Heroic (12-15 Advances)**
Legendary figures whose names are known across the land. You grow through versatility now, not raw power. Ancient guardians and planar threats test your might.

**Legendary (16+ Advances)**
Mythic heroes challenging gods and fate itself. You're among the most powerful beings in existence. Demon lords, ancient dragons, and world-ending catastrophes await.

## The Advance Menu

Each time you gain an advance (every 5 XP), choose ONE option from this menu:

### Raise a Skill

Increase one skill by one tier:
- Untrained (-2) → Novice (-1)
- Novice (-1) → Competent (+0)
- Competent (+0) → Professional (+1)
- Professional (+1) → Expert (+2)

**Cost:** 1 advance (or 2 advances if raising above your linked attribute)

### New Skill

Gain a new skill at Novice tier (-1).

### New Specialty

Gain a combat, skill, or social specialty. See the Specialties section below.

### Raise Attribute

Increase one attribute by +1.

**Important Limit:** You can only raise an attribute **once per Rank**. This prevents rushing to the +5 modifier cap.

- Maximum attribute: +3
- Choose wisely—you only get one attribute increase per rank!

### New Technique

Gain a combat technique, metamagic option, or special ability. Some techniques have **Rank Requirements** (see Techniques section).

### Increase Survivability

Choose one:
- +2 Guard (your defensive threshold)
- +2 Vitality (your health pool)

---

## Specialties

Specialties provide focused bonuses and unique capabilities. They're organized into categories for convenience, but any character can take any specialty.

### Combat Specialties

| Specialty | Benefit | Limit |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Weapon Focus** | +1 damage with one weapon type | Once per weapon type |
| **Armor Training** | Reduce armor penalty by 1 | Once per armor type |

### Skill Specialties

| **Momentum Harmony** | +1 maximum Momentum capacity | Three times |
| **Efficient Techniques** | -1 Momentum cost to one technique | Once per technique |
| **Quick Recovery** | +1 Momentum at start of combat | Once |

## Techniques

Techniques are powerful abilities that typically cost Momentum to use. Some require a minimum Rank.

### Combat Techniques (Novice)

Available to all characters:

- **Press Advantage:** When Momentum is positive, +1d6 damage
- **Defensive Strike:** Attack and gain +2 Guard until next turn
- **Momentum Strike:** On hit, gain +1 Momentum

### Advanced Combat Techniques (Requires Seasoned)

- **Whirlwind Strike:** Hit all adjacent enemies (costs 2 Momentum)

- **Devastating Blow:** Double damage dice (costs 3 Momentum)

## Bounded Accuracy

Autumn Phoenix uses bounded accuracy—your total modifier is capped at +5.

### The Math

- **Maximum attribute:** +3
- **Maximum skill:** +2 (Expert)
- **Maximum specialty bonus:** Varies, but total capped at +5

### When You Hit the Cap

Most characters reach the +5 cap in their primary skills during **Novice or Seasoned rank** (timing varies by build—focused builds cap early). After that:

- **Horizontal growth:** Gain new specialties, techniques, and abilities
- **Versatility:** Improve other skills and secondary attributes
- **Survivability:** Increase Guard and Vitality
- **Options:** Learn new techniques and metamagic

You won't get more powerful at your best skills, but you'll become more versatile and survivable.

## For Players

### Planning Your Growth

1. **Know your concept:** What do you want your character to be?
2. **Prioritize:** Focus advances on your core identity first
3. **Balance:** Don't neglect survivability—dead characters don't advance
4. **Diversify later:** Once you hit +5 cap, branch out

### Making Advance Choices

- **Early ranks:** Build toward your +5 cap in primary skill
- **After cap:** Focus on versatility, techniques, and survivability
- **Every rank:** Save your ONE attribute increase for what matters most

### Celebrating Rank Promotions

Reaching a new rank is a big deal! It should feel like a milestone in your character's story. Talk to your GM about:

- How has your character's reputation grown?
- What new opportunities does your rank unlock?
- How do NPCs react differently to you now?

**Guidelines:**
- Always give at least 3 XP for showing up
