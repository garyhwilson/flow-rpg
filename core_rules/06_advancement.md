# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

## The Milestone System

This game uses milestone-based advancement instead of experience points. Milestones represent significant moments of character growth and development that occur naturally through the story.

### Philosophy Behind Milestones

- **Story-Driven Growth:** Characters advance when the narrative calls for it
- **No Bookkeeping:** No need to track XP or calculate advancement
- **GM Control:** The GM determines when milestones occur based on story pacing
- **Equal Advancement:** All characters reach milestones together

### Types of Milestones

There are three tiers of milestones, each representing a different magnitude of character development:

1. **Minor Milestones:** Small but meaningful growth (individual development)
2. **Moderate Milestones:** Substantial character development (group achievement)
3. **Major Milestones:** Transformative evolution (campaign-defining moments)

---

## Minor Milestones

Minor milestones occur frequently and represent individual character growth moments.

### When to Award Minor Milestones

- After completing a single session
- Upon resolving a challenging encounter
- When characters make a small but meaningful discovery
- After successful use of skills in a significant way
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 1-2 sessions

### Minor Milestone Options

Choose ONE of the following when you reach a minor milestone:

**Skill Development**

- Advance one skill up one tier (Untrained → Novice → Competent → Professional)
- Gain a new skill at Novice level (-1)
- Note: Cannot advance beyond Professional tier (+1) with minor milestones

**Attribute Adjustment**

- Adjust one attribute by +1/-1 (representing shift in focus or retraining)
- Total attribute points must remain the same
- Example: Lower Grace by -1 to raise Mind by +1

**Combat Edge**

- Gain a minor combat improvement (see Combat Edges list below)
- Edges provide incremental power growth
- Can take same Edge multiple times if limit allows

**Skill Edge**

- Gain +1 to specific application of a skill
- Example: +1 to Athletics when climbing
- Narrows focus for specialized expertise

**Momentum Edge**

- Increase maximum Momentum capacity by +1 (can take up to 3 times)
- Example: Increases max Momentum from +6 to +7

### Combat Edges

Minor improvements that provide incremental power growth. Some edges can be taken multiple times up to their limit.

| Edge                  | Benefit                           | Limit                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Weapon Focus**      | +1 damage with one weapon type    | Once per weapon type |
| **Armor Training**    | Reduce armor penalty by 1         | Once per armor type  |
| **Tough**             | +2 Guard                          | Twice                |
| **Hardy**             | +2 Vitality                       | Twice                |
| **Quick Draw**        | Switch weapons as free action     | Once                 |
| **Combat Reflexes**   | +1 to defense rolls               | Once                 |
| **Fast Movement**     | +1 zone of movement per turn      | Once                 |
| **Precise Strike**    | Reroll one damage die per attack  | Once                 |
| **Momentum Harmony**  | +1 maximum Momentum capacity      | Three times          |
| **Defensive Fighter** | +1 Guard when in Defensive stance | Once                 |

### Minor Milestone Example

_After successfully infiltrating the governor's mansion and discovering evidence of corruption, the party reaches a minor milestone._

**Elena (Cleric)** chooses to adjust her attributes, lowering Presence by -1 to raise Awareness by +1, reflecting her growing perceptiveness to danger.

**Magnus (Fighter)** learns the Press Advantage combat technique, allowing him to deal +1d6 damage when his Momentum is positive.

**Lyra (Wizard)** advances her Investigate skill from Competent (+0) to Professional (+1), having honed her analytical abilities during the mission.

### Appropriate Challenges After Minor Milestones

Characters who have experienced a few minor milestones are appropriate for:

- Local threats (bandits, wolves, minor undead)
- Small-scale local problems
- Threats to villages or small communities

---

## Damage Scaling

Your damage output increases automatically as you gain milestones, keeping pace with enemy advancement:

**Milestone Damage Bonus:**

- **Every 2 Milestones:** +1 damage with all attacks
- **At 5 Total Milestones:** Weapon damage die increases (d6 → d8)
- **At 10 Total Milestones:** Gain exploding dice (6s are rerolled and added)
- **At 15 Total Milestones:** Weapon die increases again (d8 → d10)

**Example Progression:**

- **Start (0 milestones):** 2d6 + Might = 10 avg damage
- **2 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 1 = 11 avg damage
- **4 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 2 = 12 avg damage
- **5 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 2 = 13 avg damage
- **10 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 5 (with exploding) = 18 avg damage

This progression ensures martial characters remain effective against increasingly powerful threats throughout a campaign.

## Signature Moves System

Signature Moves represent a character's unique fighting style or magical technique. They are created at moderate milestones and evolve as characters advance.

### Creating a Signature Move

**Core Components:**

1. **Mechanical Effect:** What the move does (damage, protection, etc.)
2. **Momentum Cost:** Normally costs 1 less than standard (minimum 0)
3. **Thematic Element:** How it reflects your character

**Inspiration Sources:**

- Your Archetype's traditional techniques
- Your Calling's motivational focus
- Your Species' natural abilities
- Your personal character history

### Evolving Signature Moves

At each subsequent milestone, you can choose to evolve your Signature Move in one of three ways:

**Power Evolution:**

- Momentum cost increases by 1

**Efficiency Evolution:**

- Reduce Momentum cost by an additional 1 (minimum 0)
- Effect remains the same

**Versatility Evolution:**

- Add a secondary effect or option
- Momentum cost may increase by 1 if significantly more powerful
