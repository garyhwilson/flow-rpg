## Armor

Armor provides damage reduction but may impose penalties on certain actions. The right armor choice depends on your character's role and attributes.

### Armor Categories

#### No Armor
- **Damage Reduction:** 0
- **Penalties:** None
- **Flow:** Normal generation
- **Casting:** No penalties
- **Best For:** Spellcasters, characters relying on Grace, stealthy characters

#### Light Armor
**Examples:** Leather armor, padded jerkin, hide armor
- **Damage Reduction:** -1
- **Penalties:** None
- **Flow:** Normal generation
- **Casting:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Best For:** Rogues, rangers, bards, lightly armored spellcasters

#### Medium Armor
**Examples:** Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate
- **Damage Reduction:** -2
- **Penalties:** -1 to Grace-based rolls (including Grace + Combat)
- **Flow:** Cannot generate Flow from movement (no charging bonus)
- **Casting:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Best For:** Clerics, paladins, versatile fighters

#### Heavy Armor
**Examples:** Full plate, heavy field plate
- **Damage Reduction:** -4
- **Penalties:** -2 to Grace-based rolls
- **Stance Restriction:** Cannot use Aggressive stance

- **Best For:** Defenders, front-line fighters, strength-based characters

#### Shields
Shields are held in one hand and provide Guard bonuses rather than damage reduction.
- **Small Shield:** +1 Guard
- **Large Shield:** +2 Guard, -1 to Grace when attacking
- **Tower Shield:** +3 Guard, -2 to Grace for all actions, can provide cover to adjacent ally

### How Armor Works

1. When hit by an attack, subtract your armor's damage reduction from the damage
2. Apply remaining damage to Guard first, then to Vitality when Guard is depleted
3. Damage reduction applies to all damage types unless specified otherwise

### Species Interactions with Armor

- **Dwarves:** Stone Endurance works with any armor, providing layered protection
- **Elves:** Elven Focus ignores the first point of armor penalty when casting spells
- **Halflings:** Small frame has no special armor interactions
- **Humans:** Adaptable trait allows for better adjustment to armor limitations
