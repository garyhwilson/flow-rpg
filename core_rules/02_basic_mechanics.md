## BASIC MECHANICS

### Core Resolution System

**Basic Roll:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill

Roll two six-sided dice, add your relevant attribute modifier (ranging from -5 to +5) and your skill rating (ranging from -2 to +6). Compare the total to the target number to determine your success.

**Target Number:** 8 (standard difficulty)

**Success Tiers:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates Flow for opponent or creates consequences)
- **7-9:** Partial Success (succeeds with a cost or complication)
- **10-12:** Full Success (achieves your goal as intended)
- **13+:** Critical Success (generates extra Flow and exceptional results)

### The Flow System

Flow is the central resource that powers combat techniques, spells, and narrative advantages. It represents your character's momentum, focus, and command of the situation.

**Flow Range:** -6 to +10

**Starting Flow:** 0 (neutral position)

**Flow States:**
- **Positive Flow (+1 to +10):** "In the flow," riding momentum, advantage
- **Zero Flow (0):** Neutral state, balanced position
- **Negative Flow (-1 to -6):** Disrupted, against the flow, disadvantage

**Generating Flow:**
- Critical success on a roll
- Tactical positioning
- Archetype abilities
- Calling-specific triggers
- Aggressive stance success

**Spending Flow:**
- Enhance dice rolls (+1 per point spent)
- Trigger combat techniques
- Cast spells
- Access narrative advantages
- Switch stances (-1 Flow when moving from Balanced)

**Core Philosophy:** Flow is a turn-by-turn tactical resource, not a long-term pool. It fluctuates throughout an encounter, creating dynamic gameplay where characters rise to moments of glory before facing setbacks.

### Attribute System

**Attribute Range:** -5 to +5 (0 = human average)

**The Six Attributes:**

**Physical Attributes**
- **Might:** Raw physical power, strength, and endurance
- **Grace:** Agility, coordination, precision, and speed

**Mental Attributes**
- **Mind:** Intellect, reasoning, calculation, and knowledge
- **Awareness:** Perception, intuition, and attunement to surroundings

**Social Attributes**
- **Will:** Mental fortitude, determination, and spiritual power
- **Presence:** Charisma, force of personality, and social influence

**Key Principle - Approach Matters:** When making a check, you use the specific attribute that matches your approach, not a predetermined attribute for each skill.

*Example: Intimidating someone could use:*
- **Might** if physically threatening them
- **Mind** if pointing out logical consequences
- **Presence** if using sheer force of personality

### Skill System

Skills represent your character's training and expertise in various areas. Each skill has five possible ratings:

**Five-Tier Progression:**
1. **Untrained** (-2 modifier): Little to no experience
2. **Competent** (+0 modifier): Basic professional capability
3. **Professional** (+2 modifier): Skilled practitioner
4. **Expert** (+4 modifier): Recognized master
5. **Master** (+6 modifier): Legendary capability

**The 15 Core Skills:**

**Physical Skills (5)**
- **Combat:** Fighting, weapons, and tactical positioning
- **Athletics:** Running, climbing, swimming, and feats of strength
- **Stealth:** Hiding, sneaking, and avoiding detection
- **Survival:** Tracking, living off the land, and navigation
- **Finesse:** Fine manipulation, lockpicking, and sleight of hand

**Mental Skills (5)**
- **Lore:** History, academics, and specialized knowledge
- **Medicine:** Healing, anatomy, and treating injuries
- **Craft:** Making, repairing, and engineering objects
- **Investigate:** Searching, analyzing, and finding clues
- **Sorcery:** Magical theory and spellcasting practice

**Social Skills (5)**
- **Persuade:** Convincing others through reason and charm
- **Deceive:** Lying, disguising, and misdirection
- **Perform:** Entertainment, inspiration, and artistic expression
- **Command:** Leadership, intimidation, and issuing orders
- **Empathy:** Understanding others' emotions and motivations

### Physical Skill Decision Tree

When determining which physical skill to use, ask these questions:

**Is this combat-related (attacking, defending, tactical positioning)?**
- Yes → Use **Combat**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve delicate manipulation or precise finger work?**
- Yes (lockpicking, disarming traps, sleight of hand, pickpocketing) → Use **Finesse**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve avoiding detection or moving unseen?**
- Yes (hiding, sneaking, tailing someone) → Use **Stealth**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve outdoor survival or wilderness skills?**
- Yes (tracking, foraging, navigation, animal handling) → Use **Survival**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve physical exertion or strength?**
- Yes (climbing, jumping, swimming, running, breaking down doors) → Use **Athletics**

**Common Examples:**
- **Climbing a wall:** Athletics (physical exertion)
- **Climbing a wall silently:** Athletics + Stealth (GM might require two rolls or grant advantage)
- **Picking a lock:** Finesse (delicate manipulation)
- **Breaking down a door:** Athletics (strength/force)
- **Dodging an attack in combat:** Combat (tactical defense)
- **Jumping over a pit:** Athletics (physical feat)
- **Sneaking past guards:** Stealth (avoiding detection)
- **Tracking a creature:** Survival (wilderness skill)
- **Disarming a trap:** Finesse (delicate work)

**Attribute Choice Matters:**
Remember, your approach determines which attribute pairs with the skill:
- **Might + Athletics:** Forcing a door, carrying heavy loads
- **Grace + Athletics:** Acrobatic maneuvers, parkour
- **Might + Combat:** Heavy weapon strikes, shield bashing
- **Grace + Combat:** Finesse weapon attacks, dodging
- **Grace + Finesse:** Standard lockpicking, sleight of hand
- **Mind + Finesse:** Complex locks requiring understanding mechanisms

### Scene Resolution

Most gameplay occurs in scenes that follow this structure:

1. **Set the Scene:** GM describes situation and stakes
2. **Declare Approach:** Players state what they're trying to do and how
3. **Determine Roll:** GM assigns appropriate Attribute + Skill combination
4. **Roll Dice:** Player rolls 2d6 + Attribute + Skill
5. **Interpret Results:**
   - **6-:** Failure or complication
   - **7-9:** Success with a cost
   - **10-12:** Full success
   - **13+:** Critical success
6. **Narrate Outcome:** GM and player collaborate on describing what happens
7. **Flow Adjustments:** Award or deduct Flow based on outcome

### Dice Conventions

**Standard Roll:** 2d6 + modifiers
**Advantage Die:** Add 1d6, keep highest two
**Disadvantage:** Roll 3d6, keep lowest two
**Exploding Dice:** On damage rolls, any die showing a 6 is rolled again and added

### Example Resolution

**Scenario:** Climbing a crumbling tower while under arrow fire.

**Player:** "I'll use my climbing experience to find the most stable route, testing stones before putting my weight on them."

**GM:** "That's Athletics, but your careful approach uses Awareness rather than Might. Roll Awareness + Athletics."

**Player:** "I have Awareness +2 and Athletics at Competent (+0), so that's 2d6+2."

*Rolls 2d6: 4, 3 = 7, plus 2 = 9*

**GM:** "A 9 is a partial success. You make it up, but one of the stones you thought was stable breaks loose. You're hanging by one hand, and will need another check to pull yourself up before the next volley of arrows."

**Player:** "I'll spend 1 Flow to boost my roll to 10 for a full success instead."

**GM:** "Perfect. You catch yourself as the stone breaks and smoothly pull up to the next level just as arrows thunk into the spot where you were hanging."
