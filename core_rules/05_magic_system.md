# MAGIC SYSTEM

## Core Magic Concepts

### The Flow of Magic

In this world, magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Magic Access Requirements

Not everyone can cast spells. Access depends on your magical tradition:

**Archetype Override:** If your archetype provides the Sorcery skill (Wizard, Cleric, Paladin, Bard), you can cast spells regardless of attribute requirements.

**Attribute Requirements by Tradition:**
- **Arcane (Wizard's Way):** Mind + Awareness ≥ +2 (intellectual magical study)
- **Divine (Cleric/Paladin's Way):** Will + Presence ≥ +2 (faith-based channeling)
- **Primal (Ranger/Druid's Way):** Awareness + Will ≥ +2 (natural world connection)
- **Performance (Bard's Way):** Presence + Grace ≥ +2 (artistic magical expression)

These requirements create meaningful attribute choices without being overly restrictive. Failing to meet the requirement doesn't mean you can never cast—you can increase attributes through milestones.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

## Flexible Casting System

### Core Mechanic

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute. Instead:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

### Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells imposes penalties:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

Certain species traits and abilities can reduce these penalties, like the Elven Focus trait that ignores the first point of armor penalty.

### Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

## Spell Tiers

Spells are divided into five tiers based on power level and Flow cost:

### Tier 0: Cantrips (0 Flow)
- Simple magics requiring no Flow investment
- Minor effects available to all casters
- Free magical pressure without Flow cost
- Examples: Spark, Light, Mage Armor, Prestidigitation

### Tier 1: Basic Spells (0 Flow)
- Fundamental spells, Flow neutral
- Standard combat and utility effects
- Sustained casting possible without Flow management
- Examples: Bolt, Shield, Charm, Blur

### Tier 2: Advanced Spells (-1 Flow)
- Powerful effects requiring some momentum
- Significant impact, worth Flow investment
- Turning point spells in combat
- Examples: Fireball, Heal, Fly, Invisibility

### Tier 3: Expert Spells (-2 Flow)
- Major magical effects
- Battle-changing power requiring Flow buildup
- Often combat-ending when used well
- Examples: Lightning Storm, Teleport, Polymorph

### Tier 4: Master Spells (-3 Flow)
- Reality-altering magic
- Legendary effects for campaign climax moments
- Requires perfect Flow management
- Examples: Time Stop, Dominate, Meteor Swarm

## Enchanted Items

Magical items in this system interact with the Flow economy in various ways:

### Types of Enchanted Items

**Flow Batteries**
- Store Flow points for later use
- Typically have a capacity of 1-3 Flow
- Recharge between scenes or through specific actions

**Spell Catalysts**
- Reduce Flow cost of specific spells by 1 (minimum 0)
- Often tied to a specific casting attribute
- Example: "Mind Lens: When casting with Mind, reduce Bolt cost by 1 Flow"

**Attribute Enhancers**
- Temporarily boost a specific attribute for spellcasting
- Don't affect other uses of the attribute
- Example: "Awareness Amulet: +1 Awareness when casting spells"

**Stance Anchors**
- Maintain a spell's effect even when changing stances
- Normally, some spell effects might end when changing stances
- Example: "Sentinel Ring: Maintain one defensive spell when switching stances"

### Using Enchanted Items

- Most require attunement (conscious connection to the item)
- Characters can typically attune to a number of items equal to their Will attribute (minimum 1)
- Using an item's power generally requires an action unless specified otherwise
- Some items have limited charges or uses per scene/day

## Tactical Magic Guidelines

### Which Attribute When?

**Use Mind when:**
- Precision targeting is crucial

- You're in unfamiliar magical territory

**Use Will when:**
- You're at negative Flow but need to cast anyway

- You need to push through resistance or counterspells
- Reliability matters more than optimization

**Use Presence when:**
- Social effects should accompany the magic
- Intimidation or inspiration is tactically useful
- Multiple targets need to be influenced
- The appearance of the spell matters as much as its effect

### Magic in Combat Stances

**Aggressive Stance Magic**
- Focus on damaging spells
- Mind for precision targeting
- Awareness for maximum damage
- Can generate Flow from successful offensive spells

**Balanced Stance Magic**
