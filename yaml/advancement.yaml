# Autumn Phoenix RPG Advancement System
# Version: 3.0-savage-worlds-inspired
# XP and Ranks system for 30-50 session campaigns

advancement_system:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "Clean progression through XP and Ranks"
    design_principles:
      - "Simple XP tracking (tally to 5)"
      - "Single unified advance menu"
      - "5 Ranks from Novice to Legendary"
      - "Bounded accuracy maintained (+5 cap)"
      - "Horizontal growth after hitting cap"

    inspiration: "Savage Worlds advancement system"
    campaign_length: "30-50 sessions"

# ADVANCE MENU
# ============================================

advance_menu:
  overview:
    cost: "1 Advance per option (some exceptions noted)"
    choice: "Choose ONE option per advance"
    philosophy: "All options roughly equal in value"

  options:
    raise_skill:
      description: "Increase one skill by one tier"
      progression:
        - "Untrained (-2) → Novice (-1)"
        - "Novice (-1) → Competent (0)"
        - "Competent (0) → Professional (+1)"

      cost_rules:
        at_or_below_linked_attribute: "1 advance"
        above_linked_attribute: "2 advances"

      linked_attribute_rule: |
        When a skill has multiple key attributes (like Combat: Might/Grace),
        use YOUR HIGHEST key attribute to determine cost.

        This reflects that skilled practitioners naturally leverage their strengths.
        A graceful duelist and a powerful warrior both become expert fighters,
        just through different approaches.

      example: |
        Combat skill, Grace +3, Might +1
        Linked attribute = Grace (highest of key attributes)
        Raising Combat to Expert (+2) costs 1 advance (skill ≤ Grace)

        Stealth skill, Grace +2, Awareness +0
        Linked attribute = Grace (highest of key attributes)
        Raising Stealth to Expert (+2) costs 1 advance (skill ≤ Grace)

        Sorcery skill, Mind +1, Awareness +0, Will +2, Presence +0
        Linked attribute = Will (highest of key attributes)
        Raising Sorcery to Expert (+2) costs 1 advance (skill ≤ Will)

      limit: "Expert (+2) is maximum"

  acquisition: "Advance menu (1 advance)"

  design_note: |
    These are EXAMPLES, not an exhaustive list. GMs and players should
    create appropriate specialties that fit the character concept.
    The key constraint: Each specialty should be narrow enough that
    it only applies to a specific subset of skill uses.

  examples:
    combat:
      - "Dueling (one-on-one)"
      - "Formation fighting (with allies)"
      - "Mounted combat"
      - "Ranged combat"

    sorcery:
      - "Specific spell school"
      - "Ritual magic"
      - "Counterspelling"

      - "Deception"

# ============================================
# SOCIAL SPECIALTIES
# ============================================

social_specialties:
  description: "Social and narrative benefits"
  acquisition: "Advance menu (1 advance)"

  design_note: |
    Social specialties represent connections, reputation, and social position.
    GMs and players should create specialties appropriate to the campaign.
    These often provide both mechanical (+1 to relevant rolls) and
    narrative benefits (access, information, favors).

  list:
    reputation:
      effect: "+1 with specific group or faction"
      examples:
        - "Respected by the Guard"
        - "Feared by criminals"
        - "Trusted by merchants"

    contact:
      effect: "Reliable ally in specific location or field"
      examples:
        - "Informant in the capital"
        - "Sage at the university"
        - "Fence for stolen goods"

    - Via advances (1 advance per specialty)

    There is no distinction between "archetype specialties" and "general specialties."
    A Fighter template simply pre-selects certain specialties - anyone can choose them.

  why_cap_matters: |
    At +5 vs TN 8: 97.2% success (only fail on snake eyes)
    Without cap, progression would break bounded accuracy.
    The cap ensures dice rolls remain meaningful.

    Post-cap growth is horizontal:
    - More skills
    - More techniques
    - More specialties
    - Greater survivability
    - Mythic powers
