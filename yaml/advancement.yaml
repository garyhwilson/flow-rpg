  why_cap_matters: |
    At +5 vs TN 8: 97.2% success (only fail on snake eyes)
    Without cap, progression would break bounded accuracy.
    The cap ensures dice rolls remain meaningful.

    Post-cap growth is horizontal:
    - More skills
    - More techniques
    - More specialties
    - Greater survivability
    - Mythic powers
