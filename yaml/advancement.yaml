# Autumn Phoenix RPG Advancement System
# Version: 2.0-restructured
# Rebalanced milestone progression and character development

advancement_system:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "Frequent rewards with bounded progression"
    design_principles:
      - "Reward every session to maintain engagement"
      - "Horizontal growth through Minor Milestones"
      - "Vertical growth through Major Milestones"
      - "Player choice drives character development"
      - "No automatic stat increases that break math"
      - "Major power spikes arrive early enough to enjoy"

  campaign_length:
    sessions: "8-12"
    philosophy: "Campaign-length game system designed for complete story arcs"
    retirement: "Characters retire or transition to NPCs around session 12"

  milestone_schedule:
    minor:
      frequency: "Every session"
      total_expected: "8-12 in typical campaign"
      philosophy: "Horizontal growth and specialization"

    moderate:
      frequency: "Every 3 sessions"
      first: "Session 3"
      second: "Session 6"
      third: "Session 9"
      total_expected: "3 in typical campaign"
      philosophy: "Significant capability expansion"

    major:
      frequency: "Sessions 5 and 10"
      first: "Session 5"
      second: "Session 10"
      total_expected: "2 in typical campaign"
      philosophy: "Transformative evolution - regional heroes, then legendary figures"

# ============================================
# MINOR MILESTONES
# ============================================

minor_milestones:
  frequency: "Every session"
  philosophy: "Small rewards that add up over time"
  
  triggers:
    - "Complete single session"
    - "Meaningful roleplay moment"
    - "Creative problem solving"
    - "Party cooperation success"

  options:
    skill_development:
      advance_skill:
        description: "Improve one skill by one tier"
        limit: "Maximum Professional (+1) with minor"
        progression:
          - "Untrained (-2) → Novice (-1)"
          - "Novice (-1) → Competent (0)"
          - "Competent (0) → Professional (+1)"
        note: "Higher tiers require Moderate/Major milestones, OR use deepen_expertise option below"

      deepen_expertise:
        description: "Advance Professional (+1) to Expert (+2) through sustained dedication"
        requirement: "Use THREE consecutive minor milestones on the same skill"
        progression: "Professional (+1) → Expert (+2)"
        rationale: "Archetypes start with Professional skills, but standard minor cap prevents advancement. This option allows dedicated specialists to reach Expert through sustained effort over multiple sessions."
        timing: "Completes at Session 4 (sessions 1, 2, 3 minors spent)"
        example: "Fighter with Combat Professional (+1) uses minors at sessions 1, 2, and 3 to reach Combat Expert (+2) at start of session 4"
        note: "Must commit all three milestones before starting - track 'Working toward Expert in [Skill]: 1/3, 2/3, Complete' on character sheet"

        design_rationale: "Three minors delays reaching +5 cap until Session 4, maintaining bounded accuracy progression. With two minors, parties hit +5 at Session 3, causing 97.2% success rate vs TN 8 for majority of campaign. Three minors ensures power curve matches intended 8-12 session arc."

# ============================================
# ADVANCEMENT GUIDELINES
# ============================================

advancement_guidelines:
  core_principles:
    - "Skills are cheaper to improve than attributes"
    - "Specialization beats generalization early"
    - "Guard/Vitality increases are valuable but not mandatory"
    - "Momentum techniques multiply effectiveness"

  recommended_progression:
    sessions_1_3:
      priority_1: "Get primary skill to Professional (+1)"
      priority_2: "Pick up combat edge or technique"
      priority_3: "Shore up weaknesses with new skills"
      avoid: "Spreading too thin across many skills"

    session_3_moderate:
      fighter_types:
        recommended: "+3 Guard or signature move"
        alternative: "Skill to Expert (+2)"

      caster_types:
        recommended: "Metamagic or skill mastery"
        alternative: "+1 to casting attribute"

      skill_experts:
        recommended: "Skill specializations"
        alternative: "New Professional skill"

    session_5_major:
      optimal_choices:
        combat_focused: "Perfect skill (Expert + edge) or subsystem mastery"
        magic_focused: "Attribute excellence (casting stat to +3) or legendary technique"
        balanced: "Attribute excellence (two attributes +1) or Vitality transcendence"

      good_choices:
        - "Perfect skill for primary specialty"
        - "Attribute to +3 if not at cap"
        - "Subsystem mastery to gain new capabilities"

      situational_choices:
        - "Vitality transcendence (good for frontline, okay for others)"
        - "Calling transformation (only with narrative justification)"

    sessions_6_10:
      strategy: "Reach +5 cap and fill gaps"
      minors: "Edges, techniques, skill variety"
      session_6_moderate: "Whatever you didn't take at session 3"
      session_9_moderate: "Final skill/attribute push to cap"
      session_10_major: "Complete your build vision - this is your final transformative choice"

  archetype_specific:
    fighter:
      early: "Combat to Professional (+1), weapon techniques"
      mid: "Guard increases, Combat to Expert (+2)"
      late: "Might to +3, battlefield control, signature moves"

    wizard:
      early: "Metamagic, lore skills, Sorcery to Professional (+1)"
      mid: "Mind or Awareness attribute increases, spell combos"
      late: "Casting attribute to +3, Sorcery to Expert (+2), legendary techniques"

    rogue:
      early: "Sneak attack, urban specialization, Grace increases"
      mid: "Finesse/Stealth to Professional (+1), shadow techniques"
      late: "Grace to +3, death mark, impossible dodge"

    cleric:
      early: "Healing techniques, medicine skill, Will increases"
      mid: "Sorcery to Professional (+1), domain powers"
      late: "Will to +3, divine mastery, resurrection"

  custom_build_path:
    advantage: "Can optimize from start"
    sessions_1_2: "Define your niche with skills"
    session_3: "Take what archetypes can't get (moderate milestone)"
    session_5: "Adopt subsystem to catch up (major milestone)"
    sessions_6_10: "Reach +5 cap in primary area"
    session_10: "Final legendary power (major milestone)"
    result: "Become exactly what you envision"

  common_mistakes:
    spreading_thin: "Too many skills at Novice"
    ignoring_defense: "No Guard/Vitality boosts"
    hoarding_flow: "Not learning techniques"
    attribute_obsession: "Attributes over skills"

  reaching_the_cap_early:
    reality: "Specialists hit +5 in primary stat by sessions 3-5"

    this_is_intentional: "Bounded accuracy REQUIRES capping vertical growth"

    why_it_happens:
      optimizer_path: "Attribute +2 (start) + Skill +2 (Expert) + Edge +1 = +5 total"
      timing: "Can achieve by session 3 with focused choices"
      example: "Fighter: Might +3, Combat +2 = +5 by session 3-5"

    why_this_is_good:
      bounded_accuracy: "Without cap, +8 modifiers break TN 8 (97% success = not meaningful)"
      campaign_length: "System designed for 8-12 sessions, not infinite progression"
      peak_power: "You've achieved mortal mastery - this is the goal!"

    what_to_do_after:
      philosophy: "Shift from vertical to horizontal growth"

      options:
        secondary_skills:
          effect: "Develop new capabilities"
          examples: ["Combat specialist learns Lore", "Wizard learns Athletics"]
          benefit: "Become versatile, not just powerful"

        techniques_and_abilities:
          effect: "Gain new tactical options"
          examples: ["Metamagic", "Combat techniques", "Gambits"]
          benefit: "More ways to solve problems"

        survivability:
          effect: "Increase Guard and Vitality"
          benefit: "Live long enough to use your mastery"

        edges_and_specializations:
          effect: "Narrow but deep expertise"
          examples: ["Dueling +1", "Urban Stealth +1"]
          benefit: "Excel in specific situations"

        legendary_powers:
          effect: "Gain transformative abilities at Major milestones"
          examples: ["Subsystem mastery", "Mythic edges", "Legendary techniques"]
          benefit: "Transcend mortal limits in special ways"

    player_satisfaction:
      reframe: "You're not 'done' - you've graduated to mastery"
      comparison: "Like martial arts: black belt isn't the end, it's when real training begins"
      growth: "Sessions 5-12 are about becoming the complete master, not just the skilled specialist"

    examples:
      kara_the_fighter:
        session_3: "Hits +5 in Combat (Might +3, Combat +2)"
        sessions_4_9: "Learns Athletics, Command, gains 4 combat techniques, increases Guard to 23"
        session_10: "Still +5 in Combat, but now a versatile battlefield commander"
        satisfaction: "Master of combat AND tactical leader"

      aldric_the_wizard:
        session_5: "Hits +5 in Sorcery (Mind +3, Sorcery +2)"
        sessions_6_10: "Learns Lore +3, gains 6 metamagics, increases Vitality"
        session_10: "Still +5 in Sorcery, but reshapes reality with metamagic mastery"
        satisfaction: "Archmage who bends magic itself"

  power_budget:
    minor_milestone: "Worth about +0.3 to +0.5 modifier equivalent"
    moderate_milestone: "Worth about +1 modifier or significant capability"
    major_milestone: "Worth about +1 to +2 modifier plus transformative power"

    campaign_total: "Characters progress from +0 to +5 over 8-12 sessions"
    note: "Smaller per-milestone gains, but more frequent rewards maintain engagement"
