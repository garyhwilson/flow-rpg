# ============================================
# ARCHETYPES
# ============================================

archetypes:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "GURPS-style templates using identical resources"

    key_principles:
      - "Archetypes and Custom Builds use IDENTICAL resource budgets"
      - "Choosing an archetype is a shortcut, not a power boost"
      - "All 'archetype features' are specialties anyone can take"
      - "No mechanical advantage to archetype vs custom build"
      - "True classless design - templates are convenience only"

    classless_design: |
      TRUE CLASSLESS SYSTEM: Every character uses the same resource budget.

      UNIVERSAL BUDGET (all characters):
      - 4 skills: 1 Competent (0), 3 Novice (-1)
      - 2 specialties from universal list
      - 150 coins for equipment

      Archetypes are pre-made packages that follow these same rules.
      "Fighter" = a build that chose Combat as primary + martial specialties.
      Custom Build = you make those same choices yourself.

      There is NO mechanical difference - archetypes just pre-make decisions.

    flexibility:
      at_creation: "Choose archetype (quick start) OR custom build (full control)"
      during_play: "Every advance offers complete freedom"
      subsystem_access: "Any character can learn any subsystem"
      specialty_access: "All specialties available to all characters"
      no_multiclassing: "No need - all options always available"

    design_note: "This achieves GURPS-style freedom: templates are guidelines, not mechanical advantages. Choosing 'Fighter' vs building a fighter yourself yields identical characters."

  universal_resources:
    skills: "4 total: 1 Competent (0), 3 Novice (-1)"
    specialties: "2 from universal list"
    equipment: "150 coins"
    note: "All archetypes and Custom Builds use this exact budget"

  divergence_examples:
    fighter_becomes_scholar:
      starting: "Fighter template (Combat focus)"
      progression: "Takes Lore skill, learns Metamagic"
      result: "Spell blade without multiclassing"

    wizard_becomes_warrior:
      starting: "Wizard template (Sorcery focus)"
      progression: "Takes Combat skill, learns Weapon Versatility specialty"
      result: "Battle mage through natural growth"

    custom_matches_archetype:
      starting: "Custom Build"
      progression: "Chooses same skills/specialties as Fighter template"
      result: "Mechanically identical to Fighter - same character"

    hybrid_build:
      starting: "Custom Build"
      progression: "Chooses Ambush Training + Arcane Attunement specialties"
      result: "Unique hybrid - ranger/wizard blend from session 1"
