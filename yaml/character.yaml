# SPECIES
# ============================================

species:
  design_note: |
    Species attribute bonuses respect the +3 attribute cap.

    CREATION RULE: Species bonus cannot raise an attribute above +2 at creation.
    This ensures +3 attributes require advancement investment, preserving the
    intended progression timeline where +5 total modifier is reached at Seasoned
    rank (advances 4-7), not Novice rank.

    If your highest array attribute is already +2, apply the species bonus to
    a different attribute. You can still reach +3 in your primary attribute
    through the "Raise Attribute" advance option (once per rank).

# ============================================
# ARCHETYPES
# ============================================

archetypes:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "GURPS-style templates using identical resources"

    key_principles:
      - "Archetypes and Custom Builds use IDENTICAL resource budgets"
      - "Choosing an archetype is a shortcut, not a power boost"
      - "All 'archetype features' are specialties anyone can take"
      - "No mechanical advantage to archetype vs custom build"
      - "True classless design - templates are convenience only"

    classless_design: |
      TRUE CLASSLESS SYSTEM: Every character uses the same resource budget.

      UNIVERSAL BUDGET (all characters):
      - 4 skills with variable proficiency levels
      - Archetypes: 1-2 Professional (+1), remaining at Competent (0) or Novice (-1)
      - Custom Build: 1 Professional (+1), 1 Competent (0), 2 Novice (-1)
      - 2 specialties from universal list
      - 150 coins for equipment

      Archetypes are pre-made packages representing focused training.
      "Fighter" = a build that chose Combat as Professional + martial specialties.
      Custom Build = you make those same choices yourself.

      Both paths offer equivalent total skill points - archetypes just pre-make decisions.

    flexibility:
      at_creation: "Choose archetype (quick start) OR custom build (full control)"
      during_play: "Every advance offers complete freedom"
      subsystem_access: "Any character can learn any subsystem"
      specialty_access: "All specialties available to all characters"
      no_multiclassing: "No need - all options always available"

    design_note: "This achieves GURPS-style freedom: templates are guidelines, not mechanical advantages. Choosing 'Fighter' vs building a fighter yourself yields identical characters."

  universal_resources:
    skills: "4 total: 1-2 Professional (+1), remaining at Competent (0) or Novice (-1)"
    specialties: "2 from universal list"
    equipment: "150 coins"
    note: "All archetypes and Custom Builds use equivalent skill point budgets"

  divergence_examples:
    fighter_becomes_scholar:
      starting: "Fighter template (Combat focus)"
      progression: "Takes Lore skill, learns Metamagic"
      result: "Spell blade without multiclassing"

      starting: "Wizard template (Sorcery focus)"
      progression: "Takes Combat skill, learns Weapon Versatility specialty"

    custom_matches_archetype:
      starting: "Custom Build"
      progression: "Chooses same skills/specialties as Fighter template"
      result: "Mechanically identical to Fighter - same character"

    hybrid_build:

# ============================================
# CALLINGS
# ============================================

callings:
  design_philosophy: |
    Callings are psychological motivations with mechanical teeth. They generate
    Momentum, grant narrative permissions, and create dramatic tension through
    compulsions and vulnerability when struggling.

  compulsion_system:
    description: "GM can invoke your Calling's drive to create dramatic tension"
    frequency: "Once per session per character"

    when_invoked:
      choice_a:
        action: "Act on your Calling's drive"
        reward: "+2 Momentum"
        note: "The character follows their psychological compulsion"

      choice_b:
        action: "Resist the compulsion"
        cost: "-2 Momentum"
        note: "Can push to negative Momentum"

    example: |
      The Guardian sees an innocent in danger. The GM invokes the Guardian's
      drive. The player can choose: rush to protect them (gain +2 Momentum)
      or resist the urge for tactical reasons (lose 2 Momentum).
