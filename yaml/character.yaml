# ============================================
# ARCHETYPES
# ============================================

archetypes:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "Optional starting packages, not restrictive classes"

    key_principles:
      - "Archetypes are jumpstart templates, not mandatory paths"
      - "Can diverge from archetype at any milestone"
      - "Can adopt archetype features later through Custom Build"
      - "No penalties for abandoning archetype progression"
      - "Mix and match abilities through techniques.yaml"

    flexibility:
      at_creation: "Choose archetype OR custom build"
      during_play: "Every milestone offers complete freedom"
      subsystem_access: "Any character can learn any subsystem"
      no_multiclassing: "No need - all options always available"

    design_note: "This achieves the 'unicorn' of RPG design - true character freedom without multiclassing complexity"

  archetype_benefits:
    immediate:
      - "Pre-selected skills that work together"
      - "Starting equipment package"
      - "Thematic starting edge"
      - "Access to subsystem without prerequisites"

    ongoing:
      - "Suggested advancement paths (never mandatory)"
      - "Narrative framework for character"
      - "Quick character creation for new players"

  divergence_examples:
    fighter_becomes_scholar:
      starting: "Fighter with Combat Techniques"
      progression: "Takes Lore skill, learns Metamagic"
      result: "Spell blade without multiclassing"

    wizard_becomes_warrior:
      starting: "Wizard with Metamagic"
      progression: "Takes Combat skill, learns Techniques"
      result: "Battle mage through natural growth"

    custom_matches_archetype:
      starting: "Custom Build"

      trade_off_explanation: |
        Wizards trade physical resilience for magical power:

        WHAT YOU GET:
        - +2 starting Momentum (can cast Tier-2 spell immediately)
        - +7 max Momentum (vs standard +6)
        - +2 base Guard (magical protection)
        - Arcane Ward technique (Momentum-based damage reduction)

        WHAT YOU SACRIFICE:
        - Cannot effectively wear armor (penalties)
        - Still lowest Guard in party even with +2 bonus
        - Must rely on Momentum techniques and party protection

        PLAY STYLE:
