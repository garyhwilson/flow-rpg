    visible_to_players: "Optional but recommended"
    benefits:
      - "Creates tension"
      - "Players understand stakes"
      - "Collaborative storytelling"

    communication:
      gaining: "I'm gaining Flow from that failure"

      setup: "4 players, GM starts with 7 Flow (3 + 4 players)"

      scene_1_investigation:
        pc_action: "Party investigates cult hideout, PC fails Stealth check"
        gm_gains: "+1 Flow (player failure)"
        gm_total: "8 Flow"
        gm_announces: "That's +1 for me on that failure. I'm at 8 now."

        gm_spends: "3 Flow for reinforcements"
        effect: "Cultists arrive as party discovers ritual chamber"

        gm_announces: "The ritual destabilizes—spending 1 Flow, ceiling collapses!"
        gm_total: "4 Flow"

      round_4:
        situation: "Champion nearly defeated, dramatically appropriate exit"
        gm_spends: "2 Flow (escape route)"

    example_3_social_encounter:
      setup: "Negotiation with noble, GM at 6 Flow"

      round_1:
        pc_action: "PC attempts Persuade, rolls 6 total (failure)"
        gm_gains: "+1 (PC failure)"
        noble_reaction: "The Count laughs derisively"
        gm_total: "7 Flow"

      round_2:
        gm_decision: "Make this interesting"
        gm_spends: "1 Flow (introduce complication)"
        effect: "Count's rival enters, overhears negotiation"
        gm_announces: "Spending 1 Flow—Baron Markus enters"
        narrative: "Now players can leverage rivalry"
        gm_total: "6 Flow"

      resolution:
        outcome: "Party succeeds through clever play with rival"

      gm_flow: "9 Flow available"
      gm_decision: "DON'T spend—let them have the win"
      rationale: "Pacing: They earned this victory through clever play"
      alternative: "Save Flow for next scene's dramatic entrance"

    example_5_transparent_play:

      benefits:
        - "Players see consequences of failures"

      typical_session:
        start: "GM at 7 Flow"
        mid_session: "GM at 5 Flow (spent on complications)"
        climax: "GM at 9 Flow (built up from failures)"
        resolution: "GM at 3 Flow (major spends on climax)"
        next_session: "GM starts fresh at 7 Flow (3+4)"

  optional_variant:
    when_to_skip: "First 1-2 sessions, casual play, or if tracking feels burdensome"

    running_without_gm_flow:
      philosophy: "Trust narrative instincts instead of mechanical tracking"

      introduce_complications_when:
        - "Drama naturally calls for it"
        - "Players succeed too easily"
        - "Scene needs tension boost"
        - "Villain needs escape opportunity"
        - "Story demands twist"

      frequency_guideline: "1-2 complications per scene, no tracking needed"

      benefits:
        - "Less bookkeeping"
        - "More intuitive GMing"
        - "Faster pacing"
        - "Simpler for new GMs"

      drawbacks:
        - "May feel arbitrary to players"
        - "Less tension buildup"
        - "No resource scarcity for GM"
        - "Players can't anticipate complications"

    when_to_add_gm_flow:
      sign_1: "You want more structure for complications"
      sign_2: "Players enjoy knowing when complications come"
      sign_3: "You're tracking it mentally anyway"
      sign_4: "Group likes transparent mechanics"

      implementation: "Introduce after session 1-2 as 'house rule addition'"

    hybrid_approach:
      description: "Track Flow but don't announce it"
      benefit: "Structure for you, invisible to players"
      usage: "Use Flow as pacing guide only"

# SCENE DESIGN
# ============================================
#
# WARNING: This section requires significant refactoring to align with TTRPG principles.
# Current content contains video game patterns (formulaic scaling, "opposition types",
# squad composition formulas) that are fundamentally incompatible with tabletop RPG design.
#
# This section should emphasize:
# - Creating named adversaries with motivations
# - Providing guidance ranges, not rigid formulas
# - GM judgment and narrative appropriateness
# - Story-driven challenges, not encounter balance math
#
# See CLAUDE.md and .claude/instructions.md "CRITICAL: This Is A Tabletop RPG, Not A Video Game"
# section for detailed guidance on the required approach.
#
# Until refactored, use this section cautiously - trust your GM instincts over formulas.

      description: "Numerous followers, individually weak but not tissue paper"
      design_note: "Playtest showed original formula (Guard 5, Vit 3 = 8 total) resulted in one-shot kills. New formula provides 12+ durability to require 2 hits."

    worthy_opponent:
      guard: "13 + (party_milestones × 3)"

      skills: "Two or three at Expert (+2)"

      actions_per_round: 3
      legendary_resistances: "3 per scene"

      action_economy:
        philosophy: "Three actions with attack limit prevents TPK while keeping champions threatening"

        critical_rule: "Champions can make MAXIMUM 2 ATTACKS per round"

        attack_limit_rationale: "Playtest showed 3 attacks caused TPK even with damage reduction and disadvantage. Focus-fire of 3 attacks (avg 30+ damage) instantly kills any PC. Limiting to 2 attacks prevents instant-kill alpha strikes while maintaining the champion's threatening multi-action advantage."

        action_options:
          standard_recommended: "2 attacks + 1 non-attack action"
          defensive: "1 attack + 2 non-attack actions"
          note: "Champions CANNOT make 3 attacks in one round under any circumstances"

        non_attack_actions:
          movement: "Reposition, advance, retreat (1-2 zones)"
          technique: "Use combat technique or special ability (if available)"
          defense: "Take Defensive Stance action (+2 Guard until next turn)"
          grab_item: "Interact with environment, draw weapon, use item"
          tactical: "Aid ally, grant advantage, create hazard"

        typical_patterns:
          round_1: "Attack PC1 + Attack PC2 + Move to advantageous position"
          round_2: "Attack PC1 + Use technique (e.g., power attack, whirlwind) + Defensive stance"
          round_3: "Attack weakened PC + Attack fresh PC + Reposition"
          note: "Varies by situation, but never exceeds 2 attacks"

        focus_fire_guidance:
          permitted: "Champions CAN attack same PC twice in one round"
          expected_damage: "2 attacks at 2d6+2+milestones: avg 21-24 damage"
          survivability: "Most PCs survive 2 hits at appropriate tier"
          counterplay: "Party can heal, reposition, or focus down the champion"

        playtest_results:
          old_system: "3 attacks with disadvantage on 2nd/3rd = 30+ damage = instant TPK"
          new_system: "2 attacks maximum = 21-24 damage = threatening but survivable"
          verdict: "Champions remain dangerous in 4-6 round conflicts without guaranteed PC deaths"

      special: "Three actions per round with balanced economy, DR 2, legendary resistances"
      description: "Formidable threat requiring focused effort and party coordination"
      design_note: "Playtest-proven durability: 110 at milestone 0, 154 at milestone 3, 198 at milestone 6, 242 at milestone 9. Creates 4-6 round conflicts against optimized parties with ~40 DPR. Sweet Spot Edition balanced for 0-12 milestone campaigns."

      composition: "1 Champion + 4-6 Henchmen"
      tactics: "Leader coordinates followers tactically"
