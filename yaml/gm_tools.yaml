    visible_to_players: "Optional but recommended"
    benefits:
      - "Creates tension"
      - "Players understand stakes"
      - "Collaborative storytelling"

    communication:
      gaining: "I'm gaining Momentum from that failure"
      spending: "Spending 2 Momentum for complication"
      warning: "I have 8 Momentum built up..."

  play_examples:
    example_1_building_tension:
      setup: "4 players, GM starts with 7 Momentum (3 + 4 players)"

      scene_1_investigation:
        pc_action: "Party investigates cult hideout, PC fails Stealth check"
        gm_gains: "+1 Momentum (player failure)"
        gm_total: "8 Momentum"
        gm_announces: "That's +1 for me on that failure. I'm at 8 now."

        effect: "Cultists arrive as party discovers ritual chamber"
        gm_total: "5 Momentum"
        gm_announces: "Spending 3 Momentum—reinforcements arrive!"

      combat:
        round_1: "PC crits, villain fails save"
        gm_gains: "+1 (villain failure)"
        round_3: "Villain escapes dramatically"

      round_1:
        villain_action: "Major adversary attacks, hits two PCs"
        pc_failure: "PC misses attack badly"
        gm_gains: "+1 (PC failure)"
        gm_total: "5 Momentum"

      round_2:
        gm_decision: "Party doing well, need to raise stakes"
        gm_spends: "1 Momentum (environmental hazard)"
        effect: "Ceiling begins collapsing, 1d6 damage per round"
        gm_announces: "The ritual destabilizes—spending 1 Momentum, ceiling collapses!"
        gm_total: "4 Momentum"

      round_4:
        situation: "Major adversary nearly defeated, dramatically appropriate exit"
        gm_spends: "2 Momentum (escape route)"
        effect: "Villain teleports away: 'This isn't over!'"
        narrative: "Villain survives for recurring threat"
        gm_total: "2 Momentum"

    example_3_social_encounter:
      setup: "Negotiation with noble, GM at 6 Momentum"

      round_1:
        pc_action: "PC attempts Persuade, rolls 6 total (failure)"
        gm_gains: "+1 (PC failure)"
        noble_reaction: "The Count laughs derisively"
        gm_total: "7 Momentum"

      round_2:
        gm_decision: "Make this interesting"
        gm_spends: "1 Momentum (introduce complication)"
        effect: "Count's rival enters, overhears negotiation"
        gm_announces: "Spending 1 Momentum—Baron Markus enters"
        narrative: "Now players can leverage rivalry"
        gm_total: "6 Momentum"

      resolution:
        outcome: "Party succeeds through clever play with rival"
        gm_gains: "+1 (tension peaked when rivals confronted)"
        gm_total: "7 Momentum (saved for next session)"

    example_4_when_not_to_spend:
      situation: "Party low on resources, barely surviving"
      gm_momentum: "9 Momentum available"
      gm_decision: "DON'T spend—let them have the win"
      rationale: "Pacing: They earned this victory through clever play"
      alternative: "Save Momentum for next scene's dramatic entrance"

    example_5_transparent_play:
      gm_habit: "Announce all Momentum changes"
      benefits:
        - "Players see consequences of failures"
        - "Tension builds as GM Momentum increases"
        - "Players understand why complications arrive"

      typical_session:
        start: "GM at 7 Momentum"
        mid_session: "GM at 5 Momentum (spent on complications)"
        climax: "GM at 9 Momentum (built up from failures)"
        resolution: "GM at 3 Momentum (major spends on climax)"
        next_session: "GM starts fresh at 7 Momentum (3+4)"

  optional_variant:
    when_to_skip: "First 1-2 sessions, casual play, or if tracking feels burdensome"

    running_without_gm_momentum:
      philosophy: "Trust narrative instincts instead of mechanical tracking"

      introduce_complications_when:
        - "Drama naturally calls for it"
        - "Players succeed too easily"
        - "Scene needs tension boost"
        - "Villain needs escape opportunity"
        - "Story demands twist"

      frequency_guideline: "1-2 complications per scene, no tracking needed"

      benefits:
        - "Less bookkeeping"
        - "More intuitive GMing"
        - "Faster pacing"
        - "Simpler for new GMs"

      drawbacks:
        - "May feel arbitrary to players"
        - "Less tension buildup"
        - "No resource scarcity for GM"
        - "Players can't anticipate complications"

    when_to_add_gm_momentum:
      sign_1: "You want more structure for complications"
      sign_2: "Players enjoy knowing when complications come"
      sign_3: "You're tracking it mentally anyway"
      sign_4: "Group likes transparent mechanics"

      implementation: "Introduce after session 1-2 as 'house rule addition'"

    hybrid_approach:
      description: "Track Momentum but don't announce it"
      benefit: "Structure for you, invisible to players"
      usage: "Use Momentum as pacing guide only"

# SCENE DESIGN
# ============================================

scene_design:
  philosophy:
    core_principle: "Every adversary is a character with a name and motivation"
    guidance: "Stats serve the story, not the other way around"

    creating_opposition:
      step_1: "Who is this person (or creature)? Give them a name."
      step_2: "What do they want? Their motivation drives their actions."
      step_3: "Why would they oppose the characters? Conflict should feel natural."
      step_4: "What would make them stop fighting? Not every conflict ends in death."

    stat_guidance:
      note: "These ranges are starting points, not formulas. Adjust freely for your story."

        guard: "35-60"
        vitality: "40-70"
        combat_modifier: "+4 to +5"

    powerful_adversary_guidance:
      multiple_actions: "Some powerful foes act more than once per round"
      attack_limit: "Limit attacks to 2 per round to avoid instant player kills"
      non_attack_options: "Movement, techniques, defensive stances, environmental interaction"
      legendary_resistance: "Major villains might shrug off 2-3 failed saves per scene"
      rationale: "These guidelines prevent anticlimactic player deaths while keeping threats scary"

  environmental_factors:
    hazards:
      ongoing_damage:
        examples: ["Fire", "Acid", "Extreme cold"]
        effect: "1d6 per round in area"

      destructible_cover:
        durability: "10-20 damage to destroy"
        effect: "Provides protection until destroyed"

        examples: ["Chandelier", "Boulder", "Explosive barrels"]
        damage: "3d6 area effect"
        activation: "1 action + skill check"
      
      terrain_advantage:
        high_ground: "+1 attack and damage"

      the_problem: |
        AT +5 MODIFIER, TN 8 SUCCEEDS 97% OF THE TIME!
        Only snake eyes (1,1) fails. This is NOT a meaningful challenge.
        If you use TN 8 for Veteran+ rank characters, the game becomes
        boring and tension-free as players auto-succeed at everything.

      the_solution: |
        Scale TNs by party Rank:
        - Novice (advances 0-3): TN 8 standard
        - Seasoned (advances 4-7): TN 10 standard
        - Veteran+ (advances 8+): TN 10-12 standard

      what_happens_if_ignored: |
        - Novice: Game feels appropriately challenging
        - Seasoned: Game starts feeling too easy with TN 8
        - Veteran+: Players succeed at EVERYTHING with TN 8, no tension
        - Result: Boring campaign, players disengage

      remember: "THIS IS A CORE RULE. Higher Rank REQUIRES higher TNs."
