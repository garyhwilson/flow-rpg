    benefits:

    communication:
      gaining: "I'm gaining Flow from that failure"

      alternative: "Save Flow for next scene's dramatic entrance"

    example_5_transparent_play:
      gm_habit: "Announce all Flow changes"
      benefits:
        - "Players see consequences of failures"
        - "Tension builds as GM Flow increases"
        - "Players understand why complications arrive"

      typical_session:

        climax: "GM at 9 Flow (built up from failures)"
        resolution: "GM at 3 Flow (major spends on climax)"
        next_session: "GM starts fresh at 7 Flow (3+4)"

  optional_variant:
    when_to_skip: "First 1-2 sessions, casual play, or if tracking feels burdensome"

    running_without_gm_flow:
      philosophy: "Trust narrative instincts instead of mechanical tracking"

      introduce_complications_when:
        - "Drama naturally calls for it"
        - "Players succeed too easily"
        - "Scene needs tension boost"
        - "Villain needs escape opportunity"
        - "Story demands twist"

      frequency_guideline: "1-2 complications per scene, no tracking needed"

      benefits:
        - "Less bookkeeping"
        - "More intuitive GMing"
        - "Faster pacing"
        - "Simpler for new GMs"

      drawbacks:
        - "May feel arbitrary to players"
        - "Less tension buildup"
        - "No resource scarcity for GM"
        - "Players can't anticipate complications"

    when_to_add_gm_flow:
      sign_1: "You want more structure for complications"
      sign_2: "Players enjoy knowing when complications come"
      sign_3: "You're tracking it mentally anyway"
      sign_4: "Group likes transparent mechanics"

      implementation: "Introduce after session 1-2 as 'house rule addition'"

    hybrid_approach:
      description: "Track Flow but don't announce it"
      benefit: "Structure for you, invisible to players"
      usage: "Use Flow as pacing guide only"

# SCENE DESIGN
# ============================================

scene_design:
  philosophy:
    core_principle: "Every adversary is a character with a name and motivation"
    guidance: "Stats serve the story, not the other way around"

    creating_opposition:
      step_1: "Who is this person (or creature)? Give them a name."
      step_2: "What do they want? Their motivation drives their actions."
      step_3: "Why would they oppose the characters? Conflict should feel natural."
      step_4: "What would make them stop fighting? Not every conflict ends in death."

    stat_guidance:
      note: "These ranges are starting points, not formulas. Adjust freely for your story."

      inexperienced_or_fragile:

        vitality: "40-70"
        combat_modifier: "+4 to +5"

    powerful_adversary_guidance:
      multiple_actions: "Some powerful foes act more than once per round"
      attack_limit: "Limit attacks to 2 per round to avoid instant player kills"
      non_attack_options: "Movement, techniques, defensive stances, environmental interaction"
      legendary_resistance: "Major villains might shrug off 2-3 failed saves per scene"
      rationale: "These guidelines prevent anticlimactic player deaths while keeping threats scary"

  environmental_factors:
    hazards:
      ongoing_damage:
        examples: ["Fire", "Acid", "Extreme cold"]
        effect: "1d6 per round in area"

      the_problem: |
        AT +5 MODIFIER, TN 8 SUCCEEDS 97% OF THE TIME!
        Only snake eyes (1,1) fails. This is NOT a meaningful challenge.
        If you use TN 8 throughout the campaign, Sessions 4-12 will be
        boring and tension-free as players auto-succeed at everything.

      the_solution: |
        Scale TNs as party power increases:
        - Sessions 1-3: TN 8 standard (party at +2 to +4)
        - Sessions 4-6: TN 10 standard (party at +4 to +5)
