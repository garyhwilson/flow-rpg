# Autumn Phoenix RPG Magic System
# Version: 1.0-complete
# Spells, traditions, and magical mechanics

magic_system:
  philosophy:
    core_concept: "Same spell, different effects based on approach"
    design_principles:
      - "Elegance over complexity"
      - "Narrative-first with mechanical depth"
      - "Momentum integration central"
      - "Player agency in casting approach"
  
  access_requirements:
    overview: |
      To cast spells, you need:
      1. Sorcery skill (at any level)
      2. Tradition access (via specialty OR attribute requirements)

      Two paths to tradition access - both are equally valid:
      - Take a tradition specialty (bypasses attribute requirements)
      - Meet attribute requirements naturally

    tradition_access:
      arcane:
        attribute_path: "Mind + Awareness >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Arcane Attunement specialty"
        description: "Intellectual magical study"

      divine:
        attribute_path: "Will + Presence >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Divine Touched specialty"
        description: "Faith-based channeling"

      primal:
        attribute_path: "Awareness + Will >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Primal Bond specialty"
        description: "Natural world connection"

      performance:
        attribute_path: "Presence + Grace >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Performance Magic specialty"
        description: "Artistic magical expression"

    design_note: |
      The specialty path allows any character to access magic without
      specific attribute investment. This supports true classless design
      where a Might-focused warrior can take Divine Touched to cast
      divine spells without needing high Will or Presence.
