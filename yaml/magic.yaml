  # SIGNATURE FEATURE: FOUR WAYS TO CAST
  # ============================================

  signature_feature:
    headline: "Same spell, four different effects"
    elevator_pitch: |
      In Autumn Phoenix, a Fireball cast with Mind excludes your allies from the blast.
      Cast with Awareness, it seeks out enemies hiding behind cover.
      Cast with Will, it burns for rounds after impact.
      Cast with Presence, enemies flee in panic before it even hits.

      Four wizards, four different Fireballs.

    what_makes_this_unique: |
      Most RPGs treat magic as a menu - you pick Fireball and it does 8d6 fire damage.
      In Autumn Phoenix, your casting ATTRIBUTE changes what the spell actually DOES.

      This means:
      - A Mind wizard and a Presence wizard play completely differently
      - The same character can cast differently based on situation
      - Magic feels personal to your character concept
      - No two parties have the same magical options

    the_four_approaches:
      mind:
        identity: "The Calculated Caster"
        signature: "Precision and control"
        example: "Fireball that excludes allies, perfectly placed"

      awareness:
        identity: "The Instinctive Sorcerer"
        signature: "Power and perception"
        example: "Fireball that seeks enemies behind cover, +1 damage"

      will:
        identity: "The Unyielding Channeler"
        signature: "Persistence and duration"
        example: "Fireball that keeps burning for rounds"

      presence:
        identity: "The Dramatic Performer"
        signature: "Emotion and spectacle"
        example: "Fireball that causes panic before impact"

    design_note: "This is THE defining feature of Autumn Phoenix magic. Lead with it."

  philosophy:
    core_concept: "Same spell, different effects based on your casting attribute"
    design_principles:
      - "Your attribute choice IS your magical identity"
      - "Every spell should have four meaningfully different versions"
      - "Momentum integration creates casting decisions"
      - "Narrative style emerges from mechanical choice"
  
  access_requirements:
    overview: |
      To cast spells, you need:
      1. Sorcery skill (at any level)
      2. Tradition access (via specialty OR attribute requirements)

      Two paths to tradition access - both are equally valid:
      - Take a tradition specialty (bypasses attribute requirements)
      - Meet attribute requirements naturally

    tradition_access:
      arcane:
        attribute_path: "Mind + Awareness >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Arcane Attunement specialty"
        description: "Intellectual magical study"

      divine:
        attribute_path: "Will + Presence >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Divine Touched specialty"
        description: "Faith-based channeling"

      primal:
        attribute_path: "Awareness + Will >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Primal Bond specialty"
        description: "Natural world connection"

      performance:
        attribute_path: "Presence + Grace >= 2"
        specialty_path: "Performance Magic specialty"
        description: "Artistic magical expression"

    design_note: |
      The specialty path allows any character to access magic without
      specific attribute investment. This supports true classless design
      where a Might-focused warrior can take Divine Touched to cast
      divine spells without needing high Will or Presence.
