  # MANDATORY TN SCALING - CORE RULE (NOT OPTIONAL)

    rule_status: "CORE RULE - NOT OPTIONAL GUIDANCE"

    critical_warning: |
      AT +5 MODIFIER, TN 8 SUCCEEDS 97% OF THE TIME (ONLY FAILS ON SNAKE EYES).
      This is NOT a meaningful challenge. GMs MUST use higher TNs as party power grows.
      FAILURE TO SCALE TNs WILL MAKE SESSIONS 4-12 TRIVIAL AND BORING.

    rationale: "Bounded accuracy caps modifiers at +5, but this creates near-automatic success vs TN 8. The solution is mandatory TN scaling, not higher modifier caps."

    scaling_table:
      early_campaign:
        party_modifier: "+0 to +2"
        sessions: "1-3"

        note: "TN 8 feels appropriately challenging (58-86% success)"

      mid_campaign:
        party_modifier: "+3 to +4"
        sessions: "4-6"
        standard_tn: 10
        hard_tn: 12
        note: "TN 8 becomes routine (91-97%), use TN 10 for real challenges"

      late_campaign:
        party_modifier: "+5"
        sessions: "7+"
        standard_tn: 10
        hard_tn: 12
        note: "TN 8 is trivial (97.2%), TN 10 is new baseline, TN 12 for hard challenges"

    quick_reference:
      at_plus_0: "TN 8 = 58% (challenging)"
      at_plus_2: "TN 8 = 86% (reliable), TN 10 = 58% (challenging)"

      design_rationale: "At +5 cap, heroes crit ~28% of the time. This is intentional - legendary heroes should experience frequent moments of excellence. The scaling threshold (13→14 at +3) prevents crits from dominating early game while allowing heroic frequency at peak power."
