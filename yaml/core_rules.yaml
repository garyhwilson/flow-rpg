  # MANDATORY TN SCALING - CORE RULE (NOT OPTIONAL)

  mandatory_tn_scaling:
    rule_status: "CORE RULE - NOT OPTIONAL GUIDANCE"

    critical_warning: |
      AT +5 MODIFIER, TN 8 SUCCEEDS 97% OF THE TIME (ONLY FAILS ON SNAKE EYES).
      This is NOT a meaningful challenge. GMs MUST use higher TNs as party power grows.
      FAILURE TO SCALE TNs WILL MAKE SESSIONS 6+ TRIVIAL AND BORING.
      Start using TN 10 at Seasoned rank (sessions 6-10) when modifiers reach +3 to +4.

    rationale: "Bounded accuracy caps modifiers at +5, but this creates near-automatic success vs TN 8. The solution is mandatory TN scaling, not higher modifier caps."

    scaling_table:
      novice:
        party_modifier: "+0 to +2"
        sessions: "1-5"
        rank: "Novice"
        standard_tn: 8
        hard_tn: 10
        note: "TN 8 feels appropriately challenging (58-86% success)"

      seasoned:
        party_modifier: "+3 to +4"
        sessions: "6-10"
        rank: "Seasoned"
        standard_tn: 10
        hard_tn: 12
        note: "TN 8 becomes routine (91-97%), use TN 10 for real challenges"

      veteran_plus:
        party_modifier: "+5"
        sessions: "11+"
        rank: "Veteran through Legendary"
        standard_tn: 10
        hard_tn: 12
        note: "TN 8 is trivial (97.2%), TN 10 is new baseline, TN 12 for hard challenges"

    quick_reference:
      at_plus_0: "TN 8 = 42% (hard), TN 10 = 17% (very hard)"
      at_plus_2: "TN 8 = 72% (challenging), TN 10 = 42% (hard)"
      at_plus_3: "TN 8 = 83% (reliable), TN 10 = 58% (challenging), TN 12 = 28% (hard)"
      at_plus_5: "TN 8 = 97% (automatic), TN 10 = 83% (reliable), TN 12 = 58% (challenging)"

    player_expectation:
      description: |
        As a player, you should expect the GM to raise target numbers as your
        character becomes more powerful. This is not the GM being unfair - it's
        how the system maintains meaningful challenges throughout your campaign.

      what_to_expect:
        novice_rank: "TN 8 is standard. You'll fail about 30-50% of the time on important rolls."
        seasoned_rank: "TN 10 becomes standard. Your improved skills offset the higher target."
        veteran_plus: "TN 10-12 is standard. You're incredibly capable, facing epic challenges."

      why_this_matters: |
        At +5 modifier (the maximum), TN 8 succeeds 97% of the time - only snake eyes fails.
        That's not a meaningful challenge. The game is designed for GMs to increase TNs
        as you grow, so dice rolls stay exciting throughout your 30-50 session campaign.
        Think of it as facing tougher opponents and harder challenges, not arbitrary difficulty.

  success_tiers:
    base_rule: "Roll 2d6 + attribute + skill. If your total equals or exceeds the TN, you succeed. If your total is less than the TN, you fail."

    resolution_order: "First check if your total meets the TN (success or failure). Then check which tier your total falls into: failure (6 or less), partial (7-9), full (10-12), or critical (13+). Meeting a higher TN doesn't change your tier - it just means you succeeded at a harder task."

    failure:
      range: "6 or less"
      effect: "Action fails"
      momentum_change: "+1 to opponent or creates consequence"
      narrative: "Complication or setback occurs"
    
    partial_success:
      range: "7-9"
      effect: "Success with cost or complication"
      momentum_change: "No automatic change"
      narrative: "Yes, but..."
    
    full_success:
      range: "10-12"
      effect: "Complete success as intended"
      momentum_change: "No automatic change"
      narrative: "Yes, and..."
    
    critical_success:
      base_threshold: 13
      scaling_rule: "13 + (total_modifier ÷ 3, rounded down)"
      natural_12_rule: "Rolling double 6s (natural 12) is always a critical success, regardless of modifier. This mirrors snake eyes always failing."
      effect: "Exceptional success with benefits"
      momentum_change: "+1 Momentum to character"
      narrative: "Yes, and something exceptional"

      threshold_by_modifier:
        modifier_0:
          threshold: 13
          required_roll: "Natural 12 only (double 6s)"

        modifier_1:
          threshold: 13
          required_roll: "12+ on 2d6"

          required_roll: "9+ on 2d6"
          probability: "27.8%"

      design_rationale: "At +5 cap, heroes crit ~28% of the time. This is intentional - legendary heroes should experience frequent moments of excellence. The scaling threshold (13→14 at +3) prevents crits from dominating early game while allowing heroic frequency at peak power."

# ============================================
# MOMENTUM SYSTEM
# ============================================

momentum_system:
  basics:
    range:
      minimum: -3
      maximum: 6
    excess_rule: "Momentum cannot exceed your maximum. Any excess Momentum generation is lost."
    stacking_rule: "You can gain Momentum from multiple different triggers in the same round. Each trigger's 'once per round' limit applies separately."
    cap_design_note: |
      Lost excess Momentum is intentional. When multiple triggers fire and you're near +6,
      excess vanishes—this teaches players to spend Momentum at +4 or +5 rather than
      hoarding to cap. The system rewards using abilities frequently, not sitting on
      resources. If you're consistently wasting generation, that's a signal to cast
      that spell or activate that technique now.
    starting_momentum: 0
    reset: "Between scenes"
    
  starting_exceptions:
    none: "All callings now start at 0 Momentum"
    
  momentum_states:
    negative:
      range: [-3, -1]
      name: "Against the Current"
      description: "When you're struggling against the current, your character's psychology breaks down. Your Calling's deepest fear begins to manifest."

      universal_effects:
        - "Cannot cast spells (except Will-based)"
        - "-1 to initiative order"
        - "Narrative shows exhaustion and internal struggle"

      calling_consequences:
        description: "Your Calling's fear manifests mechanically when struggling"
        reference: "See character.yaml callings section for specific consequences"

        summary:
          advocate: "Truth Sense disabled - doubt clouds judgment"
          guardian: "Protective Surge trigger disabled - feel isolated"
          exemplar: "Victory Sense inverts - see only failure paths"
          seeker: "Soul Reading blocked - identity feels hollow"
          scholar: "Contingency Planning disabled - mind races uselessly"
          sentinel: "Danger Sense fails - paranoia blinds you"
          enthusiast: "Silver Lining disabled - see only pain ahead"
          champion: "Unshakeable Will wavers - intimidation can affect you"
          mediator: "Universal Understanding blocked - cannot read intent"

      dramatic_purpose: |
        This creates pressure to climb out of negative Momentum. When struggling,
        characters aren't just mechanically weaker - their psychological foundation
        cracks. This makes recovery feel like genuine triumph.

# SCENE STRUCTURE
# ============================================

scene_resolution:
  design_philosophy: |
    Scenes are explicit dramatic units in Autumn Phoenix. Unlike games where
    "scene" is informal, here scene boundaries have mechanical meaning:
    Momentum resets, Guard recovers, and narrative beats are marked.

  phases:
    1_opener:
      name: "Scene Opener"
      gm_actions:
        - "Describe situation and environment"
        - "Establish stakes clearly - what can be won or lost?"
        - "Position participants in zones"
        - "Set the tone - is this tense? Urgent? Mysterious?"
      player_actions:
        - "Ask clarifying questions"
        - "Declare initial stance (Aggressive, Balanced, Defensive)"
        - "State initial intent - what does your character want from this scene?"

      stakes_declaration:
        description: "GM explicitly states what's at stake before engagement"
        examples:
          - "The bandits want the caravan's gold. You want to protect the merchants."
          - "Lady Vera holds information you need. She wants leverage over the Duke."
          - "The collapsing temple threatens to bury the artifact forever."
        benefit: "Clear stakes create meaningful tension and informed choices"

    2_engagement:
      name: "Scene Engagement"
      structure: "Varies by scene type"
      types:
        combat: "See combat.yaml - stance-based initiative, zone movement"
        social: "Composure-based exchanges, social stances"

        experience: "XP awarded at session end, not per scene"

      narrative_thread:

        rule: "The character with the most dramatic scene-ending moment may carry 1 Momentum forward"
        determination: "Table consensus or GM call"
        examples:
          - "Aldric's desperate last stand saved the party - he carries +1 forward"
          - "Whisper's revelation about the Duke's treachery changed everything - she carries +1 forward"
          - "Bramble's sacrifice allowed the others to escape - he carries +1 forward"
        design_note: "Rewards dramatic play and creates continuity between scenes"

  optional_scene_clock:
    description: "Countdown for time pressure in scenes"
    when_to_use:
      - "The ritual will complete in 6 rounds"

      - "The fire spreads - you have 4 rounds to escape"

    clock_sizes:
      short: "4 segments - immediate pressure"
      standard: "6 segments - typical tense scene"
      long: "8 segments - extended complex situations"

    advancement:
      fixed: "Clock advances 1 segment per round"
      variable: "Clock advances on failures or complications"
      mixed: "Clock advances each round plus on failures"

    momentum_interaction:
      spend_to_slow: "Spend 2 Momentum to hold the clock for 1 round"
      dramatic_success: "Critical success may remove 1 segment"

      philosophy: "Hard cap prevents runaway progression, but creates new challenge"

      success_rates_vs_tn_8:
        at_plus_0: "41.7% (8+ on 2d6)"
        at_plus_2: "72.2% (6+ on 2d6)"
        at_plus_3: "83.3% (5+ on 2d6)"
        at_plus_5: "97.2% (3+ on 2d6 - only fail on snake eyes)"

      the_problem:
        description: "Even with +5 cap, TN 8 becomes trivial at peak power"
        solution: "GMs must use higher TNs for late-game challenges"

      tn_scaling_guidance:
        before_cap: "TN 8 for standard challenges while party is at +0 to +3 modifiers (42-83% success)"
        approaching_cap: "TN 10 as party reaches +4 to +5 (58-83% at TN 10)"
        at_cap: "TN 10-12 standard once party hits +5 cap (83% at TN 10, 58% at TN 12)"
        critical_note: "TN scaling triggers on party modifier, not rank. Most builds hit +5 during Novice-Seasoned."

      vs_alternative_caps:
        plus_4_cap: "Would give 91.7% vs TN 8 (4+ on 2d6) - better sweet spot"
        plus_3_cap: "Would give 83.3% vs TN 8 (5+ on 2d6) - too restrictive"
        plus_6_cap: "Would give 97.2% vs TN 8 (3+ on 2d6) - same problem as +5"
        design_tension: "+5 cap allows heroic growth but requires GM TN adjustment"

    cap_resolution_rule: |
      When your total bonuses exceed +5, you apply bonuses in this order until reaching +5:
      1. Attribute bonus (always applies, max +3)
      2. Skill bonus (always applies, max +2)
      3. Situational bonuses (specialties, equipment, etc.) only if room remains under cap

      Specialties that push you over +5 still provide their non-modifier benefits (narratives,
      special abilities) but don't increase your roll modifier beyond +5.

      Example: Fighter with Might +3, Combat +2, Weapon Focus +1
      - Roll modifier: +5 (Might +3 + Combat +2, capped)
      - Weapon Focus: Doesn't add to roll, but still provides any special ability it grants

    examples:
      optimized_fighter:
        might: "+3"
        combat_expert: "+2"
        weapon_focus: "+1 (special: +1 damage with chosen weapon)"
        total: "+5 to roll (capped), +1 damage from specialty"
        note: "Specialties at cap provide side benefits, not higher modifiers"
        reality: "At +5, hits TN 8 97% of the time - GM should use TN 10+ in late game"

      skilled_rogue:
        grace: "+3"
        stealth_expert: "+2"
        urban_specialist: "+1 (special: advantage in city environments)"
        total: "+5 to roll (capped), advantage in urban terrain"
        note: "Specialty provides narrative benefit even at modifier cap"
