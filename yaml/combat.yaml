# RETREAT AND ESCAPE
# ============================================

retreat_mechanics:
  overview:
    description: "Combat doesn't always end in victory or death"
    philosophy: "Provide meaningful options for escape without encouraging cowardice"

  fighting_withdrawal:
    description: "Orderly retreat while defending"
    requirement: "All party members use Defensive stance"
    effect: "Party can disengage from combat"
    cost: "Each character loses 1 Momentum"

    procedure:
      1: "All party members switch to Defensive stance"
      2: "Each member loses 1 Momentum (can go negative)"
      3: "Party moves 1 zone away as coordinated action"
      4: "Enemies may make one final attack at -2"

    tactical_note: "Coordinated defense allows escape, but costs momentum"

  rout:
    description: "Panicked flight from overwhelming danger"
    trigger: "Half or more of party at 0 Guard"
    alternative_trigger: "All party members agree to flee"

    effect: "Party scatters and escapes"
    consequences:
      immediate: "Enemies get one free attack per party member"
      momentum: "All party members drop to -3 Momentum"
      narrative: "Must regroup at safe location"

    recovery: "Party must take short rest before regaining Momentum or continuing"

  tactical_retreat:
    description: "Abandoning position while minimizing losses"
    requirement: "At least one party member remains at positive Guard"

    method: "Party designates rear guard"
    rear_guard:
      role: "Covers party escape"
      benefit: "Party members escape without attacks"
      cost: "Rear guard faces all enemies alone for 1 round"
      reward: "Rear guard gains +2 Momentum for bravery"

    design_note: "Creates heroic moments while enabling escape"

  pursuit:
    description: "Enemies chasing fleeing party"
    gm_discretion: true

    factors:
      enemy_motivation: "How much do they want to catch you?"

      speed: "Do enemies move faster?"

    escape_check:
      roll: "2d6 + grace or survival"
      tn: "10 for determined pursuit, 8 for casual"
