# ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE
# ============================================

advantage_disadvantage:
  description: "Situational modifiers that affect roll quality"

  advantage:
    mechanic: "Roll 3d6, keep the best two dice"
    when_applied:
      - "Attacking from surprise or hidden position"
      - "Attacking a prone or restrained target"
      - "Flanking (two allies in melee with same target)"
      - "Specific abilities grant advantage (e.g., Shadow Step)"
      - "Environmental benefits (high ground in certain situations)"
    effect: "Increases average roll by approximately +2"
    stacking: "Multiple sources of advantage do not stack - you still roll 3d6 keep 2"

  disadvantage:
    mechanic: "Roll 3d6, keep the worst two dice"
    when_applied:
      - "Attacking while blinded or in darkness"
      - "Attacking at extreme range"
      - "Attacking while prone"
      - "Attacking while frightened of target"
      - "Environmental penalties (difficult footing, etc.)"
    effect: "Decreases average roll by approximately -2"
    stacking: "Multiple sources of disadvantage do not stack - you still roll 3d6 keep 2"

  cancellation:
    rule: "If you have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out"
    result: "Roll normally (2d6)"
    note: "Any number of advantages cancels any number of disadvantages"

  interaction_with_modifiers:
    rule: "Advantage/disadvantage applies to the dice roll itself"
    example: "With +3 modifier and advantage: roll 3d6, keep best 2, then add +3"
    design_note: "This keeps advantage meaningful at all skill levels"

    turn_order: 2

    momentum_generation:
      excellence:
        trigger: "Any roll of 8+ (natural, before modifiers)"
        amount: 1
        note: "Rewards solid rolls, about 58% chance - competitive with other stances"

      - "No penalties"
      - "Good for uncertain situations"
  
  defensive:
    name: "Defensive Stance"

    momentum_generation:
      being_attacked:
        trigger: "Targeted by attack"
        amount: 1
        limit: "Once per round total (not per attacker)"

      effect: "On critical defense success, make free counterattack"

    tactical_notes: "Generates Momentum reliably through being targeted - turns enemy aggression into resource advantage while protecting yourself and allies"

    design_note: |
      Guard is a DAMAGE BUFFER, not a to-hit target number. Attacks roll vs TN 8
      (or higher TNs at advanced ranks). Higher Guard means more damage absorbed
      before Vitality is affected, not harder to hit. Defensive stance makes you
      tougher through larger Guard pool and damage reduction, not evasion.

    opportunity_attack:
      trigger: "Enemy leaves engagement"
      requirement: "Ready action or special ability"
      effect: "Free attack at -2"

    second_wind:
      trigger: "Your Guard is reduced to 0 or below"
      cost: "2 Momentum"
      effect: "Immediately restore Guard to 50% of maximum (round up)"
      limit: "Once per scene"
      action: "Reaction (no action cost, triggers automatically when condition met)"
      timing_clarification: |
        Damage resolution sequence when Guard hits 0:
        1. Attack damage is applied to Guard
        2. Excess damage beyond Guard applies to Vitality
        3. THEN Second Wind triggers - you may spend 2 Momentum to restore Guard to 50%
        Second Wind does NOT prevent the excess Vitality damage - it restores Guard after the hit lands.
      design_note: |
        Prevents death spirals while costing a significant resource.
        Momentum cost ensures it's a meaningful decision, not automatic.
        The 50% restoration gives breathing room without full recovery.
        Example: Guard 5, take 15 damage. Guard goes to 0, 10 damage to Vitality.
        Then spend 2 Momentum, restore Guard to 10. You took the Vitality damage but are now protected again.
