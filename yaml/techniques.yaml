# WIZARD DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES
# ============================================

wizard_techniques:
  description: "Defensive abilities for arcane casters"
  source: "Wizard archetype starting feature"

  arcane_ward:
    name: "Arcane Ward"
    description: "Instinctive magical shield that deflects incoming harm"

    trigger: "When you take damage from any source"
    action_type: "Reaction"
    flow_cost: 1

    effect: "Reduce the damage by 1d6 + Mind"

    scaling:
      mind_minus_1: "Reduces damage by avg 2.5"
      mind_0: "Reduces damage by avg 3.5"
      mind_1: "Reduces damage by avg 4.5"
      mind_2: "Reduces damage by avg 5.5"
      mind_3: "Reduces damage by avg 6.5"

    acquisition: "Wizard starting feature (free with Arcane Battery)"

    availability_note: "Other characters can learn this through Minor milestone, but it scales with Mind so wizards benefit most"

    tactical_notes: |
      - Can use multiple times per round if you have Flow
      - Competes with offensive Flow spending (spells, metamagic)
      - Most effective when combined with Shield spell
      - Consider saving Flow for emergencies vs. spending on damage
      - At Mind +3, negates roughly one-third of a Champion's attack

    example:
      situation: "Champion hits Aldric for 19 damage"
      response: "Aldric spends 1 Flow, rolls 1d6+3 = 7"
      result: "Takes 12 damage instead of 19"

    design_rationale: |
      Gives Wizards meaningful defensive choice from Session 1.
      Flow cost ensures it competes with spellcasting - you can't
      both nuke enemies AND block all incoming damage.
      Scales with Mind, keeping it wizard-optimal while allowing
      other casters to use it less efficiently.
