# GM Guidelines for Archetypes

## Balancing Archetypes in Play

### Core Principles

- **Distinct Not Dominant:** Each archetype should excel in their specialty without overshadowing others
- **Overlapping Not Identical:** Allow areas of shared competence while maintaining unique approaches
- **Situational Spotlight:** Create scenarios where each archetype can shine
- **Collaborative Synergy:** Encourage combinations that highlight complementary abilities

### Addressing Common Balance Issues

#### Combat Role Balance

- **Fighters/Paladins/Rangers (Front Line):** Ensure these archetypes have appropriate defensive options but different offensive approaches
- **Rogues/Rangers (Strikers):** Balance burst damage with positioning requirements
- **Wizards/Clerics/Bards (Support):** Ensure utility options remain valuable alongside damage capabilities

#### Skill Coverage

- **High-Skill Archetypes (Rogues/Rangers/Bards):** Challenge them beyond their comfort zones
- **Specialized Archetypes (Fighters/Wizards):** Provide opportunities where depth beats breadth
- **Hybrid Archetypes (Clerics/Paladins):** Create scenarios that reward their versatility

#### Momentum Economy

- **High Generation (Fighters/Bards):** Ensure Momentum expenditure options remain interesting
- **Efficient Users (Wizards/Rogues):** Make Momentum costs meaningful to prevent spamming
- **Consistent Output (Clerics/Paladins):** Provide occasional high-Momentum situations to showcase their potential

### Spotlight Distribution

Ensure each archetype receives regular moments of spotlight by incorporating varied challenges:

- **Fighter Spotlight:** Combat mastery, endurance challenges, intimidation opportunities
- **Ranger Spotlight:** Wilderness navigation, tracking, animal interaction
- **Paladin Spotlight:** Leadership moments, conviction tests, protection scenarios
- **Rogue Spotlight:** Infiltration, acquisition, social deception
- **Wizard Spotlight:** Magical analysis, arcane obstacles, knowledge application
- **Cleric Spotlight:** Healing crises, spiritual challenges, community service
- **Bard Spotlight:** Social influence, performance opportunities, lore utilization

## Archetype Integration in Worldbuilding

### Archetype Organizations

Incorporate archetype-specific organizations to enrich your setting:

- **Fighter Guilds:** Martial training halls, mercenary companies, royal guards
- **Ranger Enclaves:** Wilderness outposts, border wardens, nature preserves
- **Paladin Orders:** Sacred knighthoods, divine champions, oath fellowships
- **Rogue Networks:** Thieves' guilds, spy rings, artisan collectives
- **Wizard Academies:** Arcane universities, research councils, spell libraries
- **Clerical Hierarchies:** Temple organizations, healing orders, missionary groups
- **Bardic Colleges:** Performance troupes, lore keepers, diplomatic services

### Cultural Variations

Diversify archetypes across cultures to create rich setting details:

- **Regional Approaches:** How different regions adapt archetypes to local conditions
- **Species Adaptations:** How different species modify archetypal training
- **Historical Evolution:** How archetypes have changed through historical events
- **Resource Adaptation:** How archetypes adjust to available materials

### Status and Recognition

Consider how different societies view each archetype:

- **Honored Professions:** Archetypes that receive respect and authority
- **Necessary Outsiders:** Archetypes that are needed but viewed with suspicion
- **Hidden Practitioners:** Archetypes that operate covertly in certain regions
- **Competing Traditions:** Different approaches to the same archetype in conflict

## Archetype Development Through Campaign

### Milestone Integration

Use milestones to facilitate meaningful archetype development:

- **Minor Milestones:** Refinement of existing archetype techniques
- **Moderate Milestones:** Integration of new approaches within archetype framework
- **Major Milestones:** Potential hybrid development or specialization options

### Creating Growth Opportunities

Design scenarios that push characters to develop their archetypal capabilities:

- **Mentorship Encounters:** NPCs who can teach advanced techniques
- **Crucible Challenges:** Situations that force innovation within archetype traditions
- **Legacy Discoveries:** Ancient knowledge that expands archetypal understanding
- **Cross-Training Opportunities:** Exposure to related archetypes for potential hybrid growth

### Multi-Archetype Integration

Support characters who wish to incorporate elements of multiple archetypes:

- **Natural Combinations:** Fighter/Ranger, Wizard/Cleric, Rogue/Bard
- **Challenging Combinations:** Fighter/Wizard, Cleric/Rogue, Paladin/Bard
- **Training Requirements:** What's needed to justify technique acquisition
- **Specialization vs. Versatility:** Trade-offs in development focus

## Implementing Archetypes in Adventures

### Encounter Design for Archetype Diversity

Create encounters that engage different archetypes:

- **Multi-Stage Challenges:** Combat followed by obstacle followed by social challenge
- **Environment Integration:** Combat arenas with features relevant to multiple archetypes
- **Objective Variety:** Goals beyond "defeat all enemies"
- **Opponent Diversity:** Enemies that challenge different archetypal approaches

### Adventure Hooks by Archetype

Design hooks that specifically engage each archetype's interests:

- **Fighter Hooks:** Tournament invitations, martial challenges, tactical problems
- **Ranger Hooks:** Wilderness anomalies, tracking assignments, animal threats
- **Paladin Hooks:** Oath fulfillment, protection requests, corruption evidence
- **Rogue Hooks:** Heist opportunities, information acquisition, underworld tensions
- **Wizard Hooks:** Magical anomalies, arcane research, spell discoveries
- **Cleric Hooks:** Divine visions, community needs, temple responsibilities
- **Bard Hooks:** Performance opportunities, story collection, diplomatic missions

### NPC Archetypes

Use NPCs to showcase different expressions of each archetype:

- **Mentors:** Experienced practitioners who can guide PCs
- **Rivals:** Same-archetype competitors with different approaches
- **Innovators:** NPCs pushing archetypal boundaries
- **Traditionalists:** NPCs representing orthodox approaches
- **Counterparts:** NPCs with complementary archetype specializations

## Troubleshooting Common Archetype Issues

### Overshadowing

When one archetype consistently outperforms others:

- **Diagnosis:** Identify whether the issue is system imbalance, scenario design, or player skill
- **System Adjustment:** Consider tweaking Momentum costs or technique effects if system-related
- **Scenario Balance:** Incorporate more varied challenges to engage other archetypes
- **Player Guidance:** Encourage spotlight sharing and collaborative approaches

### Underperformance

When a player feels their archetype isn't effective:

- **Technique Review:** Ensure the player understands their full range of options
- **Equipment Opportunities:** Provide gear that enhances their archetypal strengths
- **Skill Application:** Suggest creative uses of their archetype abilities
- **Spotlight Design:** Deliberately create scenarios where they can excel

### Repetitive Play

When archetype abilities become predictable:

- **Scenario Variety:** Change the context in which abilities are used
- **NPC Evolution:** Have opponents adapt to predictable tactics
- **Environmental Challenges:** Create situations where standard approaches must be modified
- **Reward Innovation:** Provide Momentum bonuses for creative technique application

### Development Constraints

When players feel limited by archetype frameworks:

- **Training Narratives:** Create in-story opportunities to learn new approaches
- **Technique Adaptation:** Allow reskinning of techniques to fit character concepts
- **Hybrid Development:** Support thoughtful integration of multiple archetypal elements
- **Unique Techniques:** Work with players to develop signature abilities that reflect their character's unique approach

## Running Archetype-Focused Sessions

Occasionally spotlight specific archetypes with focused sessions:

### Fighter Focus

Remember that archetype-focused sessions should still provide meaningful roles for other characters—they simply place one archetype's capabilities at the narrative center.
