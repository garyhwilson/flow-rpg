# Archetype System Integration

This document explains how Archetypes integrate with the core Autumn Phoenix RPG system mechanics, detailing how these professional traditions interact with skills, combat, magic, and other subsystems.

## Archetype and Skill System

### Skill Proficiency Framework

Archetypes determine a character's starting skill proficiencies, providing a foundation of professional training:

- **Professional (+1):** Core competencies central to the archetype's function
- **Novice (-1):** Secondary skills that support the archetype's approach
- **Untrained (-2):** Skills outside the archetype's typical training

### Developing Your Skills

Any character can advance any skill, but each archetype has natural affinities shaped by their training and worldview.

A Fighter who wants to learn Sorcery isn't forbidden from doing so - nothing mechanically prevents it. But it requires more effort than simply advancing Combat, because arcane study lies outside their professional training. Meanwhile, a Wizard picks up new magical techniques almost effortlessly, but struggles with the martial discipline a Fighter takes for granted.

This creates organic specialization without hard restrictions. Characters remain free to develop however their story demands.

### How Each Archetype Spends Momentum

Each archetype has developed characteristic ways of channeling their momentum:

**Fighters** convert Momentum into devastating technique combinations. Watch Commander Vex chain her attacks together, each strike setting up the next. At 3 Momentum, she unleashes a whirlwind of steel that catches three enemies in a single devastating sequence.

**Rangers** spend Momentum to become one with their environment. Tracker Kira burns 2 Momentum and suddenly the forest floor reads like a book - every broken twig, every displaced leaf tells the story of her quarry's passage.

**Paladins** channel Momentum through their oaths. When Sir Aldric's companion falls, he pours 3 Momentum into his protective vow - the next blow meant for his ally strikes him instead, his oath made manifest.

**Rogues** save Momentum for the perfect moment. Shadow has been watching, waiting. When the target finally turns his back, she spends 4 Momentum on a single devastating strike that ends the fight before it begins.

**Wizards** invest Momentum into their spellwork. Magister Theron shapes a basic fire bolt, then feeds it 2 Momentum - the spell warps, splits, and strikes three separate targets as he bends the magical formulae to his will.

**Clerics** channel Momentum through faith. When poison courses through the warrior's veins, Sister Mercy pours 3 Momentum into her prayer. Divine light suffuses the wound, burning the toxin away.

**Bards** transform personal Momentum into inspiration for others. Lyssa's song reaches its crescendo and she releases 2 Momentum into the music - suddenly her companions stand taller, their weariness forgotten, her gift of momentum flowing into their next actions.

### How Each Archetype Approaches Magic

Each magical tradition naturally gravitates toward spells that resonate with their worldview and training:

**Wizards** pursue magic through intellectual understanding. Elowen the Arcanist spent decades mastering the elemental equations, and now conjures fire with mathematical precision. Wizards excel at manipulating raw magical forces - shaping elements, bending space, unraveling enchantments. They rarely develop healing magic (too instinctive) or commune with nature spirits (too chaotic for their structured approach).

**Clerics** channel divine power through faith and devotion. Brother Marcus feels his goddess's warmth flow through him when he lays hands on the wounded. Clerics naturally manifest their deity's domains - a war god's cleric radiates martial power, while a healer's priest mends wounds almost unconsciously. The intellectual magic of wizards feels cold and disconnected to them.

**Bards** weave magic through emotion, story, and performance. When Lyssa plays her lute, the very air shimmers with enchantment. Bards excel at influencing hearts and minds - inspiring allies, terrifying enemies, crafting illusions that feel real. Destructive magic feels crude to them; they prefer changing how people _perceive_ reality over forcing change.

**Paladins** manifest their oaths as divine power. Sir Aldric's shield glows with protective light because he _is_ protection - his oath made manifest. Paladin magic naturally expresses their sacred vows: purifying corruption, shielding the innocent, smiting the wicked. Deceptive or manipulative magic violates everything they stand for.

**Rangers** draw magic from their bond with the wild. Kira the Wayfinder feels the forest lend her its strength. Ranger magic connects to living things and natural forces - communicating with animals, moving through terrain unhindered, sensing threats. The artificial complexities of urban magic and mass-effect spells feel alien to their intimate, personal connection with nature.

### Learning New Techniques

Each archetype has their own path to mastery:

**Fighters** learn through repetition and experience. Commander Vex drilled the shield-bash maneuver a thousand times before it became instinct. She learned from watching her old sergeant, adapted it when she lost her shield in battle and had to use a table leg instead, and now teaches it to her own soldiers.

**Rangers** learn from the wild itself. Kira discovered the "shadow step" technique by watching how deer vanish into underbrush - three months of patient observation, then weeks of failed attempts, then suddenly she could do it too. Her mentor never taught her; the forest did.

**Paladins** learn through devotion and divine inspiration. Sir Aldric spent a year in contemplation before the _Radiant Shield_ technique came to him in a vision. His order has trained this way for centuries - prayer, service, and patience until the divine answers.

**Rogues** learn by doing and watching. Shadow never had a formal teacher. She watched the guild's best, practiced in her cramped room, and developed her own variations when the standard approaches didn't fit her smaller frame. Now younger rogues watch _her_.

**Wizards** learn through study and careful experimentation. Magister Theron spent three years researching fire magic before attempting his first modification. His tower bears scorch marks from failed experiments, but each failure taught him something. His innovations are documented, repeatable, teachable.

**Clerics** learn through faith and service. Sister Mercy didn't set out to learn the _Purifying Touch_ - she prayed desperately over a poisoned child, and the divine answered. Now she teaches others that healing techniques come not from study but from compassionate need and unwavering faith.

**Bards** learn from everywhere. Lyssa collected her _Song of Courage_ from a dwarven war-chant, an elven lullaby, and a halfling drinking song. She synthesized them during a siege when she needed something that could reach everyone. Her performances are always evolving, always incorporating new influences.
