# Archetypes

_Character Training & Professional Capabilities_

## Introduction

In the Autumn Phoenix RPG system, your character is defined by three essential pillars: Species (your heritage and physical nature), Archetype (your training and professional capabilities), and Calling (your psychological motivation and purpose). This compendium focuses on the second pillar—Archetypes—which represents the training, techniques, and approaches that define your character's capabilities in the world.

Unlike rigid class systems where characters are locked into predetermined progression paths, Archetypes in Autumn Phoenix represent foundational training that provides starting capabilities and preferred development directions while allowing for significant customization. Your Archetype determines your initial skill proficiencies, equipment options, and specialized techniques, but how you develop these foundations remains flexible.

## The Seven Core Archetypes

The seven core Archetypes cover the fundamental approaches to adventure across cultures and regions. Each represents not simply a collection of abilities but a distinctive philosophy about how to engage with the world's challenges:

- **Fighters** master physical combat through disciplined training and tactical expertise
- **Rangers** blend wilderness knowledge with combat skills to thrive in untamed territories
- **Paladins** channel conviction into protective capabilities, standing as bulwarks against threats
- **Rogues** develop specialized skills for navigating social and physical obstacles with clever solutions
- **Wizards** pursue arcane knowledge, manipulating magical forces through study and precision
- **Clerics** serve as conduits between worldly and divine realms, drawing power from spiritual devotion
- **Bards** harness creative expression as both art and power, influencing reality through performance

## Archetypes vs. Classes

Unlike rigid class systems found in some role-playing games, Archetypes in Autumn Phoenix represent foundational training that influences rather than dictates character development. This philosophy embraces several key principles:

**Skill-Based Progression:** Advancement occurs primarily through developing skills rather than predetermined class features. Your archetype provides initial skill proficiencies and learning affinities, but you can invest in any skills that suit your character concept.

**Technique Selection:** Each archetype offers signature techniques that reflect their traditional approaches, but characters can learn techniques outside their archetype through appropriate training and experience.

**Multitraining Flexibility:** Characters can incorporate training from multiple archetypes without artificial multiclassing penalties. While characters typically excel by focusing on their primary archetype's strengths, incorporating complementary training creates distinctive capabilities.

**Cultural Adaptation:** The same archetype manifests differently across cultures, regions, and species. A dwarven fighter emphasizes different techniques than an elven fighter, while maintaining the core principles that define the Fighter archetype.

## Momentum and Archetypes

The Momentum resource central to this game system interacts distinctively with each archetype, reflecting different approaches to managing and utilizing this fundamental energy:

**Fighters** build Momentum through disciplined combat techniques and spend it on powerful maneuvers, exemplifying the controlled application of physical capability.

**Rangers** generate Momentum through environmental awareness and spend it on adaptive techniques that blend combat and survival skills.

**Paladins** maintain stable Momentum reserves through unwavering conviction, using it to power protective abilities and conviction-manifesting techniques.

**Rogues** accumulate Momentum through opportunistic actions and spend it on precision techniques that maximize effectiveness from advantageous positions.

**Wizards** carefully manage Momentum through scholarly precision, channeling it into calculated magical effects with specific intended outcomes.

**Clerics** receive Momentum through divine connection, directing it into manifestations of their deity's domains and principles.

**Bards** generate Momentum through artistic performance and spend it on inspiration effects that enhance allies and influence reality through creative expression.

## Archetype Selection

When choosing an Archetype, consider the following questions:

1. **Combat Role:** How do you approach conflict situations?
2. **Skill Focus:** Which areas of expertise most interest you?
3. **Momentum Style:** How do you prefer to generate and spend Momentum?
4. **Fantasy Inspiration:** Which heroic archetypes from fiction inspire you?
5. **Group Dynamics:** What role would you like to play in your adventuring party?

Your Archetype choice provides a strong foundation but doesn't lock you into a single path. As you gain experience, you can develop your character in directions that might incorporate elements of other Archetypes or create a unique expression of your primary Archetype.

## Creating Archetypal Characters

When developing a character centered on a particular archetype, consider the following questions to create a distinctive and compelling interpretation:

**Training Context:** Who taught your character their skills? Was it formal institutional training, a single mentor, self-teaching through observation, or some combination?

**Traditional vs. Innovative:** Does your character follow established methods within their archetype, or do they incorporate unusual techniques or philosophies that distinguish them from typical practitioners?

**Cultural Interpretation:** How does your character's cultural background influence their expression of the archetype? What regional variations or species adaptations affect their approach?

**Professional Identity:** Does your character strongly identify with their archetype as a professional designation, or do they view their capabilities more as practical tools than as an identity?

**Specialization vs. Breadth:** Has your character focused deeply on core archetype techniques, or have they developed a broader range of capabilities incorporating elements from other traditions?
