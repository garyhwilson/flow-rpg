## Core Identity

The Fighter represents the mastery of physical combat through disciplined training and tactical expertise. Beyond mere brute force, true Fighters combine technical weapon skill, strategic positioning, and battlefield awareness into a comprehensive approach to martial conflict. They transform combat from chaotic violence into controlled application of force, using disciplined technique to overcome opponents regardless of the specific weapons or fighting styles employed.

- **Combat Role:** Front-line combatant, defender, and weapon specialist
- **Key Attributes:** Might, Grace, Will
- **Combat Focus:** Weapon mastery, tactical positioning, and endurance

## Mechanical Foundations

### Key Attributes
Fighters typically develop attribute distributions emphasizing physical capability and tactical awareness:

**Might:** Primary attribute supporting striking power, carrying capacity, and endurance. Contributes to damage output, intimidation presence, and combat longevity.

**Grace:** Essential for weapon manipulation, tactical movement, and defensive reactions. Contributes to attack accuracy, positioning advantage, and defensive capability.

**Will:** Critical for combat endurance, intimidation, and fighting through injuries. Supports concentration maintenance, pain tolerance, and battlefield resilience.
