# SPELLS - SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## How Magic Integrates with Core Systems

Magic in Flow RPG isn't a separate subsystem—it's fully integrated into the core mechanics through the Flow economy and stance system. This document explains how magic interacts with other game elements.

## Magic and the Flow Economy

### Flow as Universal Power Source

Magic fundamentally depends on Flow:

1. **Spell Costs**
   - Cantrips: 0 Flow
   - Standard Spells: -1 Flow
   - Advanced Spells: -3 Flow
   - Master Spells: -5 Flow

2. **Flow Generation**
   - Spellcasters generate Flow the same way as martial characters
   - **Aggressive Stance:** Offensive spells that successfully deal damage generate +1 Flow
   - **Defensive Stance:** Building Flow action grants +1 Flow per turn (or use Mage Sight)
   - Critical successes on spells may grant additional Flow (GM discretion)
   - **Key Rule:** You pay the spell cost, but gain +1 Flow back if it deals damage in Aggressive

3. **Negative Flow Considerations**
   - Most casters cannot cast at negative Flow
   - Will-based casting is the exception (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md))
   - Going negative has narrative consequences (exhaustion, patron displeasure, etc.)
   - Recovering from negative Flow is slower (see Recovery section below)

### Tactical Flow Management

Smart spellcasters manage Flow strategically:

**Conservative Approach:**
- Use cantrips (0 Flow) as your default action
- Save Flow for critical moments
- Cast standard spells (-1 Flow) regularly
- Reserve advanced/master spells for emergencies

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Spend Flow early for maximum impact
- Use powerful spells to end fights quickly
- Risk going negative for victory
- Rely on Will casting or allies to recover

**Balanced Approach:**
- Mix cantrips and standard spells
- Monitor party's total Flow
- Coordinate with allies for Flow generation
- Keep reserve for defensive/utility casting

## Magic and Combat Stances

### Aggressive Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- Offensive spells that defeat enemies generate +1 Flow
- Natural fit for damage-dealing magic
- Mind precision keeps allies safe
- Awareness maximizes damage output

**Drawbacks:**
- -2 to Guard makes caster vulnerable
- Encourages burning Flow quickly
- Less time for defensive spells
- Risky for fragile spellcasters

**Best Spells:**
- Spark (cantrip for Flow generation)
- Bolt (standard ranged attack)
- Fireball (advanced area damage)
- Lightning Storm (master devastation)

### Balanced Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- Versatile, no penalties
- Good for utility spells
- Can switch to other stances as needed
- Maintains decent defense

**Drawbacks:**
- No Flow generation bonus
- No defensive bonus
- Jack-of-all-trades, master of none
- Less optimal than specialized stances

**Best Spells:**
- Any utility spells
- Charm and social magic
- Invisibility and stealth
- Heal and support spells

### Defensive Stance Casting

**Benefits:**
- +2 to Guard protects vulnerable casters
- Can build Flow (+1 per turn)
- Can use Mage Sight instead of building Flow
- Maintains concentration better
- Will casting excels here

**Drawbacks:**
- No offensive Flow generation
- Slower pacing
- Party may need you to act faster
- Less dramatic casting style

**Best Spells:**
- Shield and protective magic
- Blur and evasion spells
- Dispel to counter enemy magic
- Mage Armor maintenance

### Stance Transitions

Changing stances is a significant decision:

1. **Spell Maintenance**
   - Most ongoing effects persist through stance changes
   - GM may rule particularly disruptive changes break concentration
   - Will casting specifically maintains through changes
   - Stance Anchor items protect specific effects

2. **Tactical Considerations**
   - Switch to Aggressive for finishing blows
   - Switch to Defensive when injured
   - Switch to Balanced for multi-purpose turns
   - Coordinate stance changes with party

## Magic and Character Creation

### Archetypes and Magic

## Magic and Equipment

### Armor Penalties

Armor interferes with spellcasting:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Elven Focus (ignore first point)
- Magic items that reduce penalties
- High base casting bonus offsets penalties
- Tactical stance choices

**Building Armored Casters:**
1. Elf in Light Armor = no penalty
2. High Sorcery + Mind offsets light armor penalty
3. Defensive Stance reduces need for heavy armor
4. Shield spell provides magical protection

### Weapons and Casting

**Free Hand Requirement:**
- Most spells require a free hand for gestures
- Weapons in one hand, casting with other
- Two-handed weapons prevent most spellcasting
- Some traditions use weapon as focus (staff, ritual dagger)

**Weapon + Spell Combos:**
- Attack with weapon, cast spell same turn (if system allows)
- Cast defensive spell, attack with weapon
- Use weapon in Aggressive, spell in Balanced
- Coordinate for narrative awesome

### Focus Items

Different traditions use different focus items:

**Arcane (Mind):**
- Spellbooks (for learning/reference)
- Wands (precise channeling)
- Staves (versatile tools)
- Component pouches

**Wild (Awareness):**
- Natural items (crystals, feathers)
- Tattoos or body art
- Blood or life essence
- Environmental channeling

**Divine (Will):**
- Holy symbols
- Sacred texts
- Relics
- Prayer beads

**Performance (Presence):**
- Musical instruments
- Masks or costumes
- Props and stage tools
- Audience participation

Focus items are **narrative elements**, not mechanical requirements, unless you want to add that layer to your game.

## Magic and Advancement

### Improving Casting

Characters improve magical ability through:

**Milestone Advances:**
1. **Increase Sorcery** - Makes all casting better
2. **Increase Casting Attribute** - Improves chosen approach
3. **Gain New Spells** - Expand spell repertoire
4. **Magic-Related Skills** - Support casting narratively

**In-Game Learning:**
- Find spellbooks or scrolls
- Train with mentors
- Experiment with new approaches
- Discover ancient magical traditions

### Spell Access by Tier

Suggested spell access progression:

**Character Creation:**
- All Cantrips
- 3-4 Standard Spells
- 1-2 Advanced Spells (if Sorcery +2 or higher)
- 0 Master Spells

**Milestone 2-3:**
- Gain 1-2 more Standard Spells
- Gain 1 Advanced Spell
- Possibly first Master Spell (if Sorcery +3)

**Milestone 4-5:**
- Full access to Standard/Advanced Spells
- Gain 1-2 Master Spells
- Specialize in preferred approaches

**Milestone 6+:**
- Access to all spell tiers
- Multiple Master Spells known
- Custom/signature spells

These are guidelines, not hard rules. GMs should adjust based on campaign needs.

## Magic and Narrative

### Magical Problem-Solving

Spells can solve problems outside combat:

**Encourage Creative Use:**
- Light for exploration
- Invisibility for infiltration
- Charm for social encounters
- Teleport for travel

**Maintain Challenge:**
- Not every problem has a spell solution
- Spell effects are temporary
- Casting is noticeable (usually)
- Resources are limited

**Example: Locked Door**
- No "knock" spell exists
- Could use Bolt to blast it (loud, generates opposition)
- Could use Charm on guard (social approach)
- Could use Invisibility to sneak past (doesn't solve door)
- Picking the lock is still valid

### Magic in Your World

Consider these worldbuilding questions:

**Prevalence:**
- How many people can cast? (Default: ~45% meet minimum)
- Are casters common or rare?
- Do non-casters fear magic?

**Regulation:**
- Are there magical authorities?
- Is magic legal everywhere?
- Are certain spells banned?

**Economy:**
- Can you buy magical services?
- How much does a healing spell cost?
- Are magic items available for purchase?

**Education:**
- How do casters learn?
- Are there magical schools?
- Is apprenticeship the norm?

**Traditions:**
- Which traditions exist in your world?
- Do they conflict or cooperate?
- Are there lost magical traditions?

These questions shape how magic feels in your game and create adventure opportunities.

## Magic and the Party

### Party Composition

**Multiple Spellcasters:**
- Encourage different approaches (one Mind, one Will, etc.)
- Create situations that reward variety
- Manage Flow economy carefully
- Avoid overlapping spell selections

**Mixed Party:**
- Martial characters generate Flow
- Casters spend Flow for impact
- Natural synergy in action economy
- Diverse problem-solving approaches

**No Spellcasters:**
- Game still works fine
- More reliance on skills and tactics
- Different narrative feel
- May want to adjust magic item availability

### Coordinated Casting

Multiple casters can coordinate:

**Sequential Casting:**
- One caster Shields, another attacks
- One caster creates advantage, another exploits
- Stagger resource expenditure
- Maintain Flow balance

**Complementary Approaches:**
- Mind caster provides precision
- Awareness caster provides damage
- Will caster provides reliability
- Presence caster provides social effects

**Concentration Stacking:**
- Multiple casters maintain different effects
- Create overlapping advantages
- Build defensive layers
- Overwhelming magical presence

## Edge Cases and Rulings

### Combining Magic with Other Abilities

**Archetype Abilities + Spells:**
- Most archetype abilities work with spells
- Fighter's weapon expertise doesn't apply to spell attacks
- Rogue's sneak attack doesn't work with spells (unless GM allows)
- Bard's inspiration affects spell rolls

**Skills + Spells:**
- Perform skill enhances Presence casting
- Arcana skill represents magical knowledge
- Stealth works with Invisibility
- Medicine complements Heal spell

### Counterspelling

**Dispel as Counter:**
- Ready action to Dispel when enemy casts
- Roll Dispel vs. enemy's casting roll
- Success negates their spell
- Costs your action and Flow

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Worth it for stopping Master Spells
- Less valuable vs. cantrips
- Mind Dispel calculates what to counter
- Will Dispel overpowers by force

### Magic and Death

**Healing the Dying:**
- Heal spell can restore dying characters
- Will-cast Heal works even at negative Flow
- Can cast even if you're dying (GM discretion)
- Narrative weight of saving someone

**Resurrection:**
- Not in base spell list
- If allowed, extremely expensive (Master Spell minimum)
- Require significant quest/sacrifice
- Narrative consequences for cheating death
