# SPELLS - GM GUIDELINES

## Running Magic in Your Game

Magic in Autumn Phoenix RPG is designed to be both mechanically elegant and narratively rich. This guide helps you leverage the flexible casting system to create memorable magical moments while maintaining balance and pacing.

## Interpreting Attribute-Based Casting

### Encouraging Player Creativity

The four-attribute casting system gives players tremendous creative freedom. As GM, your role is to:

1. **Honor the Narrative** - Let players describe HOW they're casting with their chosen attribute
2. **Enforce the Mechanics** - Apply the mechanical benefits consistently
3. **Celebrate Variety** - Encourage players to switch attributes based on situations
4. **Maintain Balance** - Don't let one attribute dominate all situations

### Example Rulings

**Player:** "I want to cast Bolt with Presence to intimidate the bandit leader."
**GM Response:** "Great! The bolt will do Presence + d6 damage, and if you hit, the spectacular display will cause fear. Roll for the attack, and we'll see how the bandits react to your show of force."

**Player:** "Can I cast Heal with Mind to diagnose what's wrong with the poisoned merchant?"
**GM Response:** "Absolutely. You'll restore Mind + d6 Vitality, and your analytical approach will let you identify the specific poison. This might give you advantage on finding an antidote."

### When to Say No

Sometimes a player's interpretation doesn't fit the attribute benefits. Guide them gently:

**Player:** "I cast Fireball with Mind and want it to do maximum damage."
**GM:** "Mind gives you precision and control—you can exclude allies from the blast. If you want maximum damage, that's the Awareness approach. Which would you prefer?"

## Balancing Magic in Combat

### Momentum Economy Management

Magic is balanced through the Momentum economy. As GM, you can:

1. **Control Starting Momentum** - Tougher encounters might start with characters at lower Momentum
2. **Manage Enemy Actions** - Enemies that generate opponent Momentum can limit spellcasting
3. **Vary Encounter Length** - Longer fights strain spellcaster resources
4. **Create Anti-Magic Zones** - Areas where casting is difficult or impossible

### Spellcaster-Heavy Parties

If your party has multiple spellcasters:

- Design encounters that reward different casting approaches
- Include enemies with high Guard (favoring Mind's precision) and low Guard (favoring Awareness's damage)
- Create social encounters where Presence casting shines
- Include situations where Will casting's reliability becomes crucial

### Non-Spellcaster Balance

Ensure martial characters remain relevant:

- Magic costs Momentum, weapon attacks often generate it
- Positioning and zone control matter more than pure damage
- Some enemies resist magic but are vulnerable to physical attacks
- Martial characters are more consistent turn-to-turn

## Magical Traditions in Your World

### Using the Four Traditions

The spell system includes four cultural traditions (see [00_introduction.md](00_introduction.md)):

1. **Arcane Academies** (Mind)
2. **Wild Talent** (Awareness)
3. **Divine Channeling** (Will)
4. **Performance Magic** (Presence)

These are narrative frameworks, not mechanical restrictions. Use them to:

- Create faction conflicts (Academy vs. Wild Mages)
- Develop quest hooks (recover stolen holy relic)
- Build setting detail (famous Bard colleges)
- Establish NPC backgrounds

### Custom Traditions

Feel free to create your own magical traditions:

**Example: Blood Magic**

- Primary Attribute: Will or Awareness
- Focus Items: Ritual daggers, blood vials
- Philosophy: Magic powered by life force
- Mechanical Hook: Can spend Vitality instead of Momentum for spells

**Example: Rune Magic**

- Primary Attribute: Mind
- Focus Items: Carved stones, inscribed items
- Philosophy: Magic bound into permanent forms
- Mechanical Hook: Prepare spells in advance, cast without roll

Keep custom traditions narratively distinct but mechanically compatible with the core system.

## Handling Edge Cases

### Casting at Negative Momentum

Will-based casting allows casting at negative Momentum. Guidelines:

1. **It's a Feature, Not a Bug** - This is the Will caster's strength
2. **Narrative Consequences** - Going deeply negative might anger a deity/patron
3. **Recovery Takes Time** - Negative Momentum recovers slowly (see [02_system_integration.md](02_system_integration.md))
4. **Physical Toll** - Describe the strain of channeling power when depleted

### Multi-Target Spells

Some spell benefits affect "zones" or "all enemies." Rulings:

1. **Define Zones Clearly** - Use the zone system (Close/Near/Far)
2. **Reasonable Limits** - "All enemies" means those in the affected zone(s)
3. **Mind Precision** - Mind casting can exclude allies from area effects
4. **Narrative Scale** - Describe the awesome scope of large-area spells

### Concentration and Stance Changes

Some spell effects "maintain for scene." Guidelines:

1. **Default Rule** - Effects persist through stance changes unless disruptive
2. **GM Judgment** - Particularly disruptive actions might break concentration
3. **Will Advantage** - Will casting specifically maintains through disruption
4. **Stance Anchors** - Magic items can protect effects (see enchanted items)

## Creating Magical Encounters

### Spellcaster Enemies

When designing enemy spellcasters:

1. **Choose Primary Attribute** - Pick one or two attributes they prefer
2. **Select Appropriate Spells** - Match spell power to the adversary's capability
3. **Consider Momentum Economy** - Enemy casters need Momentum too
4. **Tactical Behavior** - Show smart casting choices to teach players

**Example: Bandit Wizard**

- Attributes: Mind +2, others +0
- Spells: Bolt (Mind for precision), Shield (Mind for calculated defense)
- Tactics: Stays at Far range, uses Mind to avoid hitting allies
- Momentum: Starts at 2-3 Momentum, conserves for key moments

**Example: Wild Sorcerer**

- Attributes: Awareness +3, others +0
- Spells: Spark, Bolt, Fireball (all Awareness for maximum damage)
- Tactics: Aggressive, burns Momentum quickly for big damage
- Momentum: Starts at 4 Momentum, goes negative if desperate

### Anti-Magic Challenges

Not every encounter should favor magic. Create variety:

1. **Silence Zones** - Areas where spells can't be cast
2. **Magic-Resistant Enemies** - High bonuses to resist/dodge spells
3. **Counterspelling Foes** - Enemies that can Dispel aggressively
4. **Social Encounters** - Where blasting isn't an option

### Magic-Friendly Scenarios

Sometimes, let spellcasters shine:

1. **Puzzle Encounters** - Where specific spells provide solutions
2. **Investigation Scenes** - Mage Sight and detection spells excel
3. **Group Combat** - Area spells handle many weak enemies
4. **Dramatic Moments** - Big spell at climactic time

## Enchanted Items and Magic

### Distributing Magical Items

Enchanted items interact with the Momentum economy (see [spell_tiers/](spell_tiers/) for item types):

1. **Momentum Batteries** - Extend spellcaster staying power
2. **Spell Catalysts** - Make specific spells more efficient
3. **Attribute Enhancers** - Improve casting effectiveness
4. **Stance Anchors** - Provide tactical flexibility

**Balance Guidelines:**

- 1 minor item per character by Seasoned rank
- 1 moderate item per character by Veteran rank
- 1 major item per character by Heroic rank
- Legendary items are extremely rare campaign rewards

### Attunement Limits

Characters can attune to items equal to their Will (minimum 1):

- Low Will characters must choose which items to use
- High Will characters can leverage more magical gear
- Creates meaningful choice for martial vs. magical items
- Temporary attunement changes take a full scene

### Creating Custom Magic Items

When designing custom magical items:

1. **Tie to Momentum Economy** - Items should interact with Momentum
2. **Support Playstyle** - Match items to character approaches
3. **Avoid "Must Haves"** - Don't create items every character needs
4. **Narrative Significance** - Give items history and meaning

**Example Custom Item: Stormcaller's Baton**

- Category: Spell Catalyst
- Effect: Reduce cost of lightning/storm spells by 1 Momentum
- Requires: Attunement
- Story: Carved from a tree struck by lightning during a legendary duel

## Adjudicating Spell Effects

### Spell Descriptions as Guidelines

The spell entries provide mechanical frameworks, but:

1. **Allow Creative Applications** - Players will find clever uses
2. **Maintain Mechanical Boundaries** - Don't let spells do everything
3. **Rule Consistently** - Once you allow something, it sets precedent
4. **Discuss Intent** - Understand what players want to accomplish

### The "10-Foot Rule"

If players try to use cantrips to trivialize challenges:

1. **Narrative Limits** - Cantrips are minor magic
2. **Time Constraints** - Some solutions take too long
3. **Imperfect Solutions** - Cantrip fixes are temporary
4. **Encourage Resourcefulness** - But don't shut down creativity

**Example:**
**Player:** "I use Light repeatedly to search the entire dungeon safely."
**GM:** "Light lasts a scene, so you can explore one area at a time. The dungeon is large enough that fully searching it will take days. What's your approach?"

## Common GM Questions

### "Can I limit spells in my game?"

Yes, but carefully:

- Communicate restrictions during Session Zero
- Have narrative justification (magic is illegal, rare, etc.)
- Ensure restrictions apply equally to NPCs
- Consider offering alternative options

### "What if a player only uses one attribute?"

This is fine! It's a valid specialization:

- They'll excel in some situations
- They'll struggle in others
- Other party members will complement them
- They might diversify as they advance in rank

### "How many spells should a character know?"

The system doesn't strictly limit known spells:

- Narrative limits (spellbook size, learned prayers, etc.) are fine
- Consider: All cantrips + 3 spells per tier at creation
- Learn new spells through play (finding scrolls, training, etc.)
- Higher-tier spells are automatically more limited by Momentum cost

### "Should I use spell slots instead of Momentum?"

The Momentum system is core to the game's design:

- Momentum creates dynamic pacing
- It unifies magic, combat, and narrative momentum
- Slots would require significant system redesign
- If you prefer slots, consider another system

## Session Zero Discussions

Before starting your campaign, discuss:

1. **Magic Prevalence** - How common is magic in your world?
2. **Tradition Importance** - Do traditions matter mechanically or just narratively?
3. **Item Availability** - How easy is it to find/buy magical items?
4. **House Rules** - Any modifications to spell rules?
5. **Player Expectations** - What kind of magical experience do players want?

_Use these guidelines as a framework, not a straightjacket. The best ruling is the one that keeps your game moving, honors the fiction, and ensures everyone has fun._
