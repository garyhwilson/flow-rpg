# SPELLS - INTRODUCTION

## Overview

Magic in Flow RPG represents one of the most revolutionary aspects of the system: a unified casting framework where spells adapt to the caster's approach rather than being locked to a single tradition. This modular documentation covers the complete spell system, from basic cantrips to legendary master spells.

## Core Magic Philosophy

### The Flow of Magic

Magic is fundamentally tied to the Flow that permeates reality. Spellcasters learn to channel this Flow through various approaches, shaping it according to their own strengths and perspectives. Unlike traditional magic systems where each caster type has unique spells, here the same spells can be cast through different mental and spiritual approaches, creating diverse effects.

### Flexible Casting System

The revolutionary aspect of this magic system is that spells aren't tied to a single casting attribute:

- **Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- **Attribute Choice:** Player chooses which attribute to use based on their approach to casting
- **Power Source:** Spend Flow to fuel spells
- **Each Attribute Provides Different Benefits:** The same spell produces different effects based on the attribute used

### The Four Casting Approaches

#### Mind + Sorcery: The Wizard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Precision, control, avoiding allies, calculated effects
- **Narrative Flavor:** Academic magic, formulaic casting, spellbooks
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Mind lets you exclude specific targets from the blast

#### Awareness + Sorcery: The Sorcerer's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Maximum damage, sensing weaknesses, magical detection
- **Narrative Flavor:** Instinctive magic, raw power, natural talent
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Awareness deals maximum damage output

#### Will + Sorcery: The Divine/Pact Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Cast at negative Flow, maintain concentration, push through adversity
- **Narrative Flavor:** Channeling external power, faith magic, patron bonds
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Will works even when you're at negative Flow

#### Presence + Sorcery: The Bard's Way
- **Mechanical Benefits:** Social effects, fear/inspiration, affecting groups
- **Narrative Flavor:** Reality-shaping through force of personality, performative magic
- **Example:** Casting Fireball with Presence causes survivors to flee in terror

## Magic Access Requirements

Not everyone can cast spells. To access magic, a character must have:

- **Mind + Awareness ≥ +2** total
- This represents the minimum mental acuity and perceptual awareness needed to sense and manipulate magical Flow
- Approximately 45% of the population meets this requirement
- Even Wizards, Clerics, and Bards must meet this requirement!

This requirement creates meaningful attribute choices without being overly restrictive. Failing to meet the requirement doesn't mean you can never cast—you can increase these attributes through milestones.

### Mage Sight (Innate to All Casters)

All characters who meet the magic access requirement possess Mage Sight, an innate ability to perceive magic:

- **Out of Combat:** Detect magic within Near zone, no roll needed
- **In Defensive Stance:** Can use instead of building Flow
- **Automatic:** Not a spell or cantrip, just natural perception
- **Enhanced by Awareness:** Awareness +3 or higher can identify spell types and magical signatures

## Spell Categories

Spells are divided into four tiers based on power level and Flow cost:

### Cantrips (0 Flow)
- Basic magical effects that require no Flow expenditure
- Available to all casters regardless of skill
- Limited but useful effects
- Examples: Spark, Light, Mage Armor

### Standard Spells (-1 Flow)
- Common magical effects that cost 1 Flow
- Bread and butter of magical combat and utility
- Examples: Bolt, Shield, Charm, Blur

### Advanced Spells (-3 Flow)
- Powerful magic requiring 3 Flow
- Game-changing effects with significant impact
- Examples: Fireball, Heal, Invisibility, Dispel

### Master Spells (-5 Flow)
- Highest tier of magic requiring 5 Flow
- Legendary effects that can turn the tide of battle
- Examples: Lightning Storm, Teleport, Dominate, Time Stop

## Armor and Casting

Wearing armor while casting spells imposes penalties:

- **Light Armor:** -1 to Sorcery rolls
- **Medium Armor:** -2 to Sorcery rolls
- **Heavy Armor:** Cannot cast spells

Certain species traits and abilities can reduce these penalties, like the Elven Focus trait that ignores the first point of armor penalty.

## Spells and Flow Generation

Spellcasters can generate Flow through successful offensive magic, just like martial characters generate Flow through successful attacks:

- **Aggressive Stance:** When you successfully cast an offensive spell that deals damage to an enemy, you generate +1 Flow
- **Applies to all damage-dealing spells:** Spark, Bolt, Fireball, Lightning Storm, and other damage spells
- **Must deal damage:** Spells that only provide buffs, debuffs, or utility effects don't generate Flow through this method
- **Works with spell costs:** You still pay the spell's Flow cost, but successful damage generates +1 Flow back

This rule ensures spellcasters can participate in the Flow economy as actively as martial characters, making aggressive spellcasting a viable combat strategy.

**Example:** A wizard casts Bolt (-1 Flow) in Aggressive Stance and hits, dealing damage. They spend 1 Flow for the spell but gain 1 Flow from the successful attack, resulting in net 0 Flow cost.

## Spell Failure

When you roll 6 or less on a casting roll:
- Spell fails, generates +1 Flow for enemy
- Each attribute produces different failure manifestations:
  - **Mind failures:** Miscalculation causes minor paradox
  - **Awareness failures:** Magical backlash, sense overload
  - **Will failures:** Power source rejects you temporarily
  - **Presence failures:** Reality refuses to bend, embarrassing

## Design Philosophy

The spell system adheres to Flow RPG's core design principles:

1. **Elegance over Complexity** - One unified casting mechanic instead of multiple subsystems
2. **Narrative-First with Tactical Depth** - Same spell, different narrative based on approach
3. **Flow as Universal Resource** - Magic fully integrated into the Flow economy
4. **Player Agency** - Choose how to cast each spell based on the situation

*This spell system represents the flexible, narrative-driven approach to magic that defines Flow RPG. Every casting choice creates a unique story while maintaining mechanical clarity and balance.*
