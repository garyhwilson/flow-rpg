# ADVANCED & EXPERT SPELLS (TIER 2 & 3)

## Overview

This document covers both Tier 2 (Advanced) and Tier 3 (Expert) spells—powerful magic that can change the course of an encounter. These spells require Momentum investment but deliver game-changing effects. When a caster reaches for an advanced spell, everyone at the table knows something significant is about to happen.

## Design Philosophy

Advanced and Expert spells occupy the high-impact tiers:

1. **Decisive Moments** - Turn the tide of combat or solve major problems
2. **Resource Investment** - Momentum cost demands strategic timing
3. **Memorable Magic** - These are the spells players remember
4. **Scaling Power** - Dramatically more powerful than basic spells
5. **Tactical Depth** - Each tier offers different power-to-cost ratios

Experienced casters build toward these spells, managing Momentum to enable powerful effects when they matter most.

## Spell Tiers

### Tier 2: Advanced Spells (-1 Momentum)

**Examples:** Fireball, Heal, Fly, Invisibility, Web

Moderate Momentum investment for significant battlefield impact. These spells are accessible enough to use regularly once you've built some Momentum through cantrips or basic spells.

### Tier 3: Expert Spells (-2 Momentum)

**Examples:** Lightning Bolt, Teleport, Polymorph, Scrying, Wall of Fire

Higher Momentum investment for dramatic results and game-changing capabilities. Reserved for critical moments or when you've built substantial Momentum.

## Casting These Spells

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery

- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute provides dramatically different benefits
- Momentum cost varies by spell tier
- Still affected by armor penalties

**Success Thresholds:**

- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Momentum for enemy, lose Momentum cost anyway)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication)
- **10+:** Full success (described effect occurs in full glory)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect plus +1 Momentum)

# TIER 2: ADVANCED SPELLS (-1 MOMENTUM)

## FIREBALL

**Area damage spell**

Fireball is the iconic area damage spell—a roiling sphere of magical flame that detonates across a zone, catching multiple enemies. It's the spell every combat caster dreams of using, and for good reason: properly timed, Fireball can end encounters decisively.

### Mind + Sorcery: Precision Detonation

- **Damage:** 2d6 + Mind to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Exclude X targets from blast (X = Mind attribute)
- **Narrative:** Calculated blast wave, mathematical precision, controlled detonation
- **Tactical Use:** Hitting enemies without harming allies in melee
- **Example:** Mind +3 can exclude 3 targets from the explosion

### Awareness + Sorcery: Maximum Blast

- **Damage:** 2d6 + Awareness to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Absolute maximum damage output
- **Narrative:** Instinctive power release, feels for maximum effect, overwhelming force
- **Tactical Use:** Pure damage when ally positioning doesn't matter
- **Example:** Awareness +3 deals 2d6+3 to everyone in zone

### Will + Sorcery: Unyielding Inferno

- **Damage:** 2d6 + Will to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Can cast at negative Momentum
- **Narrative:** Channeled through sheer determination, powered by faith/will, never fails
- **Tactical Use:** Desperation Fireball when depleted
- **Example:** At -2 Momentum, can still cast (ends at -3 Momentum)

### Presence + Sorcery: Terrifying Conflagration

- **Damage:** 2d6 + Presence to entire zone
- **Range:** Far
- **Special:** Survivors must flee or cower (morale break)
- **Narrative:** Apocalyptic display, psychologically devastating, shows overwhelming power
- **Tactical Use:** Damage + battlefield control through terror
- **Example:** Weaker enemies flee, stronger enemies shaken

### Important Rules

- **Zone Effect:** Affects entire combat zone (typically 3-6 targets)
- **No Friendly Fire:** Except Mind version which excludes specific targets
- **Environmental Effects:** Might ignite flammable materials, create smoke
- **Momentum Cost:** -1 Momentum (Tier 2 spell)

### GM Notes

- Fireball is THE iconic spell—make it feel awesome
- Mind's exclusion allows "party Fireball" (allies in blast zone)
- Awareness + high attribute = devastating damage
- Presence's terror effect can end encounters without killing everyone
- Consider environment: Fireball in a wooden building has consequences
- Multiple enemy groups = multiple zones = multiple Fireballs needed

## HEAL

**Restore health to target**

Heal channels magical energy to repair injuries, restore vitality, and save lives. It's the most important spell in any support caster's arsenal, capable of bringing allies back from the brink of death.

### Mind + Sorcery: Analytical Healing

- **Effect:** Restore Mind + d6 Vitality
- **Range:** Touch
- **Special:** Can diagnose injuries, identify poisons/diseases

- **Example:** Mind +3 restores 3+d6 Vitality and identifies the poison

### Awareness + Sorcery: Intuitive Mending

- **Effect:** Restore Awareness + d6 Vitality
- **Range:** Touch
- **Special:** Sense what needs healing, prioritize critical injuries

### Presence + Sorcery: Inspiring Renewal

- **Effect:** Restore Presence + d6 Vitality
- **Range:** Touch
- **Special:** Inspiring recovery, target gains +1 to next action
- **Narrative:** Heroic restoration, dramatic revival, witnesses are awed
- **Tactical Use:** Healing + morale boost
- **Example:** Presence +3 restores 3+d6 Vitality plus confidence boost

### Important Rules

- **Touch Range:** Must be adjacent to target
- **Living Targets Only:** Doesn't work on constructs/undead (usually)
- **Not Resurrection:** Can't bring back the truly dead
- **Multiple Castings:** Can heal same target multiple times
- **Momentum Cost:** -1 Momentum (Tier 2 spell)

### GM Notes

- Heal changes survival math significantly
- Will version letting dying casters save allies is heroic
- Mind's diagnosis can be adventure hook (rare poison!)
- Presence version's inspiration is narrative but meaningful
- Touch range means healer must be in danger zone
- Consider allowing Heal to cure diseases/poisons at GM discretion

## INVISIBILITY

**Concealment for scene**

Invisibility renders the target invisible to normal sight, providing a massive bonus to stealth and enabling infiltration, escape, or surprise attacks. Each attribute approach offers different advantages beyond simple concealment.

### Mind + Sorcery: Perfect Refraction

- **Effect:** +Mind + 3 to Stealth for scene
- **Range:** Touch

- **Tactical Use:** Walk past guards, social invisibility
- **Example:** Guards see you but mind doesn't register

### Important Rules

- **Stealth Rolls:** Still need Stealth checks in risky situations
- **Breaking Invisibility:** Depends on version (Will is exception)
- **Self or Touch:** Can cast on allies

## DISPEL

**Counter or remove magic**

Dispel is the anti-magic spell, capable of countering enemy spells or removing magical effects. It's the caster's answer to hostile magic, and different attributes approach dispelling in dramatically different ways.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Unweaving
