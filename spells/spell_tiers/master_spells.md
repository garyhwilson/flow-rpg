# TIER 4: MASTER SPELLS (-3 MOMENTUM)

## Overview

Master spells represent the pinnacle of magical power—legendary effects that reshape battles, alter reality, and create moments that become campaign legends. Costing 3 Momentum, these spells are significant investments that deliver correspondingly massive results. When a master spell is cast, the entire table stops to witness the awesome display of power.

## Design Philosophy

Master spells define the apex of the magic system:

1. **Legendary Moments** - These spells become campaign-defining stories
2. **Significant Investment** - 3 Momentum represents half of maximum Momentum capacity
3. **Reality-Bending** - Effects that seem impossible at lower tiers
4. **Strategic Climaxes** - Cast at decisive moments when you've built substantial Momentum
5. **Accessible Power** - Reduced cost makes them achievable in extended combats

Master spells aren't for everyday use—they're for the moments when everything is on the line and only overwhelming magical power will suffice. The rebalanced cost makes them achievable goals rather than once-per-campaign events.

## Casting Master Spells

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
**Momentum Cost:** -3 Momentum (must have at least 3 Momentum, except Will approach)

- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute creates fundamentally different expressions of power
- Significant resource investment—requires building Momentum through cantrips and combat
- Still affected by armor penalties
- Combine with Aggressive stance to partially recover cost on damage spells

**Success Thresholds:**

- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Momentum for enemy, lose 3 Momentum anyway—costly)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication—still impressive)
- **10+:** Full success (legendary effect unfolds as described)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect plus +1 Momentum recovered)

## LIGHTNING STORM

**Massive area attack**

Lightning Storm summons a tempest of electrical fury that strikes multiple zones simultaneously. It's the master-tier answer to overwhelming numbers—when enemies surround you on all sides, call down the thunder and reshape the battlefield with apocalyptic force.

### Mind + Sorcery: Tactical Devastation

- **Damage:** 3d6 to chosen targets across multiple zones
- **Range:** Far (all zones in sight)
- **Special:** Choose specific targets with tactical precision
- **Narrative:** Calculated lightning strikes, each bolt perfectly placed, mathematical annihilation
- **Tactical Use:** Eliminate priority targets across entire battlefield
- **Example:** Strike all 7 enemies in 3 different zones, avoid all allies

### Awareness + Sorcery: Instinctive Apocalypse

- **Damage:** 3d6 to all enemies in sight
- **Range:** Far (all zones in sight)
- **Special:** Instinctively knows every foe, no allies hit
- **Narrative:** Storm that senses enemies, lightning seeks out threats, natural disaster
- **Tactical Use:** Maximum damage to maximum enemies
- **Example:** 12 enemies across 4 zones all struck simultaneously

### Will + Sorcery: Sustained Cataclysm

- **Damage:** 3d6 to multiple zones
- **Range:** Far (all zones in sight)
- **Special:** Maintains for full scene through concentration
- **Narrative:** Channeled storm, continuous lightning, unshakable power
- **Tactical Use:** Ongoing area denial, continuous damage
- **Example:** Lightning strikes every turn for entire scene

### Presence + Sorcery: Terror from Above

- **Damage:** 3d6 to multiple zones
- **Range:** Far (all zones in sight)
- **Special:** Utterly terrifying, breaks morale of all who witness
- **Narrative:** Apocalyptic display, divine wrath made manifest, psychologically devastating
- **Tactical Use:** Damage + complete battlefield control through terror
- **Example:** Enemies flee, surrender, or cower in fear

### Important Rules

- **Multi-Zone Effect:** Can affect entire battlefield
- **Scaling with Enemies:** More enemies = more impressive
- **Environmental Effects:** Creates ongoing hazards (fires, crater-like damage)
- **Momentum Cost:** At 5 Momentum, this is usually your entire pool

### GM Notes

- Lightning Storm is **THE** big damage spell
- Mind's targeting allows "friendly storm" (allies unharmed)
- Awareness automatically spares allies (instinctively knows them)
- Will's sustained effect is incredibly powerful (3d6 per turn for scene!)
- Presence's terror can end encounters without killing everyone
- Describe this cinematically—make it feel awesome
- Aftermath should be visible (scorched earth, terrified survivors)
- This spell announces "POWERFUL WIZARD HERE"

## TELEPORT

**Instant movement**

Teleport allows instantaneous transportation across vast distances, defying the normal constraints of space and time. Whether through calculated coordinates, sensory connections, force of will, or dramatic flair, Teleport enables impossible escapes, surprise attacks, or triumphant arrivals.

### Mind + Sorcery: Coordinate Calculation

- **Effect:** Teleport anywhere you can calculate coordinates for
- **Range:** Potentially unlimited
- **Special:** Can teleport to places never visited (if you have precise information)
- **Narrative:** Mathematical spatial folding, calculated transitions, precise positioning
- **Tactical Use:** Teleport to map coordinates, geometric calculation
- **Example:** "The throne room is 47.3 meters northwest, 12 meters up"

### Awareness + Sorcery: Sensory Connection

- **Effect:** Teleport anywhere you can sense or have been
- **Range:** Must have prior connection to location
- **Special:** Sense destination, can't teleport "blind"
- **Narrative:** Feel the destination, sense the space, instinctive navigation
- **Tactical Use:** Return to known locations, sense familiar places
- **Example:** "I teleport to the inn where we stayed—I remember it clearly"

### Will + Sorcery: Forced Transit

- **Effect:** Can bring others, even unwilling (opposed Will)
- **Range:** Based on knowledge of destination
- **Special:** Force unwilling targets to come with you
- **Narrative:** Command space to obey, force reality to bend, unshakable power
- **Tactical Use:** Kidnap enemies, force allies to safety, tactical repositioning
- **Example:** Grab the villain and teleport them to jail (opposed Will roll)

### Presence + Sorcery: Dramatic Arrival

- **Effect:** Teleport with theatrical timing
- **Range:** Based on knowledge of destination
- **Special:** +3 to next Social action, impossibly perfect timing
- **Narrative:** Arrive at the perfect dramatic moment, theatrical entrance/exit
- **Tactical Use:** Social encounters, inspiring appearances, dramatic rescue
- **Example:** Appear as villain is monologuing: "I don't think so."

### Important Rules

- **Familiar Destination:** GM determines if destination is "known enough"
- **Passengers:** Can bring willing creatures (number = attribute)
- **Carrying Capacity:** Normal carrying limits apply
- **Teleport Failure:** Failing this spell is dangerous (GM discretion: off-target, scattered, damage)

### GM Notes

- Teleport can break adventures if overused
- Establish limitations early (must have been there, need coordinates, etc.)
- Failure should be consequential (end up in ocean, inside rock, etc.)
- Mind version is most versatile (anywhere calculable)
- Awareness requires sensory connection (most restrictive)
- Will forcing others enables kidnapping (very powerful)
- Presence enables perfect timing (arrive exactly when dramatic)
- Consider: Teleport wards, blocked locations, magical interference
- Use for awesome moments: dramatic rescue, triumphant arrival, desperate escape

## DOMINATE

**Control target's actions**

Dominate seizes control of another creature's mind and body, forcing them to act according to your will. It's the ultimate social/control spell—the apex of mind-affecting magic that turns enemies into puppets, allies into champions, or bystanders into tools.

### Mind + Sorcery: Logical Compulsion

- **Effect:** Commands seem reasonable to target
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Target rationalizes your commands as their own ideas
- **Narrative:** Plant logical-seeming motivations, rewrite their reasoning, "of course I should do this"
- **Tactical Use:** Subtle control, target doesn't realize they're dominated
- **Example:** "You should tell me the password" becomes target's idea

### Awareness + Sorcery: Sensory Possession

- **Effect:** Sense and use target's skills and knowledge
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Access their memories, skills, knowledge while controlling them
- **Narrative:** Ride their senses, feel what they feel, know what they know
- **Tactical Use:** Information extraction + control
- **Example:** Force guard to give password while learning fortress layout

### Will + Sorcery: Absolute Control

- **Effect:** Complete control if your Will exceeds theirs
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene
- **Special:** Total domination of weaker-willed targets, they become extensions of your will
- **Narrative:** Overpower their volition, force absolute obedience, unshakable command
- **Tactical Use:** Perfect control of weak-willed enemies
- **Example:** Will +3 vs. target's Will +1 = complete puppet

### Presence + Sorcery: Devoted Servant

- **Effect:** Target believes they want to serve you
- **Range:** Near
- **Duration:** Scene (may persist longer)
- **Special:** Target enthusiastically serves, convinced of your greatness
- **Narrative:** Become their idol, they worship you, zealous service
- **Tactical Use:** Create temporary fanatic ally
- **Example:** Enemy captain becomes fervent devotee mid-battle

### Important Rules

- **Strong-Willed Targets:** High Will provides resistance
- **Opposed Roll:** Target can resist (their Will + d6 vs. your cast)
- **Scene Duration:** Default, but effects may linger
- **Moral Implications:** This is mind control—players and characters may object
- **Suicidal Commands:** Won't work (jump off cliff, stab self, etc.)

### GM Notes

- Dominate is powerful and morally complex
- Discuss boundaries in Session Zero
- Mind version is subtlest (target doesn't know)
- Awareness lets you rifle through memories (interrogation)
- Will version is classic mind control (absolute when it works)
- Presence creates genuine devotion (scariest version?)
- Set difficulty: Weak-willed NPC = auto, Strong-willed = opposed, Legendary = may be immune
- Duration: "Scene" default, but Presence may cause lasting loyalty
- Moral weight: This is violation—NPCs and PCs may react strongly
- Consider: Detect Magic reveals domination, Dispel can free victims

## TIME STOP

**Pause time briefly**

Time Stop is the ultimate tactical spell—the ability to freeze the flow of time itself, granting you freedom to act while the world stands still. It's the spell of desperate gambits, perfect positioning, and dramatic monologues. When time stops, only you remain in motion.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Chronostasis

- **Effect:** Calculate optimal actions, take 3 full turns

### Awareness + Sorcery: Temporal Awareness

- **Range:** Self + perception range
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment"
- **Special:** Perceive and respond to all threats/opportunities at once
- **Narrative:** Sense all possible futures, instinctive perfect timing, awareness beyond time
- **Tactical Use:** Perfect reaction, counter anything
- **Example:** Enemy casts spell—you stop time, Dispel it, move away—time resumes, spell fails

### Will + Sorcery: Extended Chronostasis

- **Effect:** Extend duration through force of will
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** "Frozen moment" or longer with concentration
- **Special:** Maintain time stop as long as you concentrate

- **Duration:** "Frozen moment"
- **Special:** Deliver speech/performance while time is frozen, guaranteed social impact when time resumes
- **Narrative:** Theatrical time stop, dramatic reveal, captive audience
- **Tactical Use:** Guaranteed social effect, perfect timing for reveal
- **Example:** Stop time, walk through frozen battle explaining villain's plan, resume time with +3 to Social

### Important Rules

- **Actions During Time Stop:** Can't directly harm frozen creatures (but can position, buff, etc.)
- **No Damage Dealing:** Attacks during time stop don't deal damage (or all resolve when time resumes)
- **Positioning:** Can move freely, position perfectly
- **Preparation:** Can cast buffs, drink potions, prepare actions
- **Interaction:** Can't interrogate frozen people or read minds

### GM Notes

- Time Stop is narratively powerful but has limits
- Prevent infinite loops: set maximum benefit
- Mind: 3 turns of buffing/positioning
- Awareness: Perfect counter to one action
- Will: Extended but not infinite (GM discretion)
- Presence: Social action, not combat exploit
- Can't use Time Stop to kill helpless enemies (anti-climactic)
- Best uses: escape impossible situations, perfect positioning, dramatic moments
- Consider: Some beings may be immune (time elementals, gods)
- This is the "I WIN" button—use sparingly
- Make it feel awesome when cast
- Balance: Costs 5 Momentum (huge investment)

## Master Spell Strategy

### When to Cast Master Spells

**Clear Uses:**

- **Overwhelming Opposition:** Lightning Storm vs. army
- **Desperate Escape:** Teleport from prison/trap
- **Critical Control:** Dominate enemy leader
- **Perfect Setup:** Time Stop for tactical advantage

**Consider These Factors:**

### Building Toward Master Spells

- Or build to 5 during scene
- Use cheaper spells early
- Save master spell for climax

- Time master spell with party readiness
- Make it a team moment

### After Casting Master Spell

**Immediate Aftermath:**

- Party must protect you
- Victory or flee

**Narrative Impact:**

- Everyone knows you're powerful now
- Reputation spreads
- NPCs react differently
- "You're the one who called lightning storm?"
