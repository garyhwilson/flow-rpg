# TIER 1: BASIC SPELLS (0 MOMENTUM)

## Overview

Tier 1 spells represent the fundamental magical effects that all casters rely on. Costing 0 Momentum, these spells maintain Momentum equilibrium—making them sustainable and reliable for regular use. They provide significantly more power than cantrips while remaining accessible even at low Momentum. A well-chosen basic spell at the right moment can turn the tide of an encounter without depleting your resources.

## Design Philosophy

Basic spells occupy the foundational tier in the magic system:

1. **Sustainable Use** - No Momentum cost means unlimited casting potential
2. **Meaningful Impact** - Significantly more powerful than cantrips
3. **Tactical Variety** - Different spells for different situations
4. **Momentum Neutral** - Maintain your Momentum state while producing powerful effects
5. **Combat Staple** - The bread and butter of magical combat

Experienced casters use basic spells as their primary magical tool, building Momentum with cantrips and spending it on advanced/master spells for critical moments.

## Casting Basic Spells

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
**Momentum Cost:** 0 Momentum (no Momentum cost to cast)

- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute provides different benefits
- Can cast at any Momentum level (even negative Momentum)
- Still affected by armor penalties
- Combine with Aggressive stance to generate +1 Momentum on damage

**Success Thresholds:**

- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Momentum for enemy)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication)
- **10+:** Full success (described effect occurs)
- **13+:** Critical success (full effect plus +1 Momentum)

## BOLT

**Ranged magical attack at Far range**

Bolt launches a concentrated projectile of magical energy at a distant target. It's the upgrade from Spark, trading Momentum cost for extended range and increased damage. Every combat caster relies on Bolt for ranged offense.
