# CANTRIPS (0 FLOW)

## Overview

Cantrips are basic magical effects that require no Flow expenditure. They represent the fundamental expressions of magical ability—small but reliable effects that any caster can produce indefinitely. While less powerful than standard spells, cantrips form the foundation of magical practice and remain useful throughout a caster's career.

## Design Philosophy

Cantrips serve several purposes in the magic system:

1. **Baseline Action** - Casters always have something magical to do
2. **Flow Conservation** - Allows saving Flow for critical moments
3. **Narrative Flavor** - Shows constant magical ability
4. **Combat Viability** - Keeps casters relevant at 0 Flow

Even legendary archmages use cantrips—not every problem requires a master spell.

## Casting Cantrips

**Casting Roll:** 2d6 + [Chosen Attribute] + Sorcery
- Choose which attribute to use (Mind, Awareness, Will, or Presence)
- Each attribute provides different benefits
- No Flow cost means unlimited use
- Still affected by armor penalties

**Success Thresholds:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates +1 Flow for enemy)
- **7-9:** Partial success (reduced effect or complication)
- **10+:** Full success (described effect occurs)

## SPARK

**Basic magical attack at Close range**

Spark represents the most fundamental offensive magic—a burst of pure magical energy directed at a target. It's the cantrip every combat caster relies on when conserving Flow or finishing weakened enemies.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Strike
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Precisely targeted (can avoid allies in melee)
- **Narrative:** Calculated trajectory, mathematical precision, no wasted energy
- **Tactical Use:** When allies are engaged with enemy, or need to avoid environmental hazards

### Awareness + Sorcery: Intuitive Blast
- **Damage:** 1d6 (+1 damage on 10+)
- **Special:** Can "feel" weak points for bonus damage
- **Narrative:** Instinctive aim, sensing vulnerabilities, natural magic
- **Tactical Use:** When maximum damage matters, even from a cantrip

### Will + Sorcery: Unyielding Force
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Can cast even at negative Flow
- **Narrative:** Powered by determination, channeled through sheer willpower, never fails you
- **Tactical Use:** When you're depleted but need to keep fighting

### Presence + Sorcery: Intimidating Display
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Special:** Target gets -1 to next action (fear effect)
- **Narrative:** Spectacular magical display, theatrical presentation, shows your power
- **Tactical Use:** When you want to demoralize as well as damage

### GM Notes
- Spark is the combat caster's bread and butter at 0 Flow
- Encourage players to describe their Spark attacks uniquely
- The debuff from Presence Spark doesn't stack with multiple hits
- At Close range, Spark works for melee casters

## LIGHT

**Illuminate area for scene**

Light creates magical illumination that lasts for a scene. It's one of the most universally useful cantrips, valuable in exploration, social situations, and even combat. Every adventuring caster learns Light early.

### Mind + Sorcery: Controlled Illumination
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Precise control—can dim/brighten, create patterns, focus beam
- **Narrative:** Mathematical light angles, calculated brightness, precise shapes
- **Tactical Use:** Spotlight specific areas, create signals, avoid alerting enemies

### Awareness + Sorcery: Revealing Radiance
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Can sense what light reveals (hidden doors, invisible creatures glow faintly)
- **Narrative:** Light that seeks truth, reveals hidden things, pierces illusions
- **Tactical Use:** Investigation, detecting hidden enemies, finding secret passages

### Will + Sorcery: Persistent Light
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Persists even in magical darkness
- **Narrative:** Unyielding light that refuses to be extinguished, powered by faith/will
- **Tactical Use:** Countering darkness effects, maintaining visibility in hostile conditions

### Presence + Sorcery: Dramatic Lighting
- **Effect:** Bright light in Near zone
- **Special:** Theatrical effects—colors, patterns, dramatic timing (+1 to Perform)
- **Narrative:** Stage lighting, impressive displays, emotion-evoking illumination
- **Tactical Use:** Social encounters, performances, intimidation through spectacle

### GM Notes
- Light lasts "a scene" (10-15 minutes typically)
- Can be cast on objects (coins, stones, weapons) for mobile light
- Multiple Light cantrips don't stack—use brightest one
- Magical darkness vs. Light is GM discretion (Will version automatically wins)

## MAGE ARMOR

**Protective barrier, self only**

Mage Armor creates a semi-tangible magical barrier that absorbs incoming damage. It's the defensive cantrip that keeps fragile casters alive. Unlike actual armor, it doesn't interfere with casting—making it the perfect protection for spellcasters.

### Mind + Sorcery: Calculated Barrier
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 3 damage
- **Special:** Calculated angles optimize protection
- **Narrative:** Geometric force fields, perfect angles, mathematical deflection
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Awareness + Sorcery: Alert Shield
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Alerts you to incoming attacks (narrative warning)
- **Narrative:** Instinctive barrier that reacts to threats, sense danger before it hits
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Will + Sorcery: Stalwart Protection
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Maintains through concentration breaks and disruption
- **Narrative:** Unshakable barrier powered by determination, won't fail when needed
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Presence + Sorcery: Impressive Aegis
- **Effect:** +2 Guard, absorbs first 2 damage
- **Special:** Shimmers impressively, provides +1 to social rolls (shows your power)
- **Narrative:** Visible aura of magical protection, displays your magical prowess
- **Duration:** Until damage absorbed or scene ends

### Important Rules
- **Doesn't Stack with Physical Armor:** Use whichever provides better Guard
- **Breaks After Absorbing Damage:** Once the absorbed damage is depleted, Guard bonus remains until end of scene
- **Can Be Recast:** Cast again once it breaks (still costs 0 Flow)
- **Self Only:** Cannot cast on allies (see Shield spell for protecting others)

### GM Notes
- Mage Armor is crucial for caster survivability
- The absorption is "first damage" per scene, not per hit
- Mind's 3 absorption vs. others' 2 is significant over time
- Presence version's social bonus makes you look mysteriously protected
- Breaking Mage Armor can be dramatic moment (barrier shatters!)

## Cantrip Tactics

### When to Use Cantrips

**Always Viable:**
- When Flow is low/negative
- Against weak enemies
- While building Flow in Defensive Stance
- When conserving resources

**Situational Choice:**
- Cantrip vs. Standard Spell depends on resources
- Spark (0 Flow) vs. Bolt (-1 Flow) is common decision
- Light (0 Flow) vs. Invisibility (-3 Flow) for different approaches
- Mage Armor (0 Flow) vs. Shield (-1 Flow) for self vs. party protection

### Cantrip Combinations

**Mage Armor + Defensive Stance:**
- +2 Guard from armor, +2 Guard from stance = +4 total
- Build Flow while protected
- Very safe caster position
- Encourages aggression from enemies (good for party tactics)

**Spark + Aggressive Stance:**
- Attack with Spark (0 Flow)
- Generate +1 Flow on success
- Repeat for Flow generation
- Eventually have Flow for bigger spells

**Light + Investigation:**
- Awareness Light reveals hidden things
- Combine with Search or Investigation skills
- No resource cost for thorough exploration
- Can maintain throughout investigation

### Cantrip Limitations

**What Cantrips Can't Do:**
- High damage (maximum 1d6 + modifier)
- Affect large areas (usually self or single target)
- Last beyond a scene (except Mage Armor effects)
- Replace standard+ spells for major effects

**Maintaining Balance:**
- Cantrips are useful but limited
- Don't let players trivialize challenges with cantrips
- Standard+ spells should feel more powerful
- Resource management (Flow) remains important

## Custom Cantrips

GMs may allow custom cantrips following these guidelines:

**Power Level:**
- Damage: Maximum 1d6 + attribute
- Defense: Maximum +2 Guard or absorb 2-3 damage
- Duration: Scene maximum
- Range: Close to Near typically
- Targets: Self or single target

**Design Template:**

**[Cantrip Name] - [Basic Description]**

- **Mind:** [Precision/control benefit]
- **Awareness:** [Instinct/sensing benefit]
- **Will:** [Reliability/persistence benefit]
- **Presence:** [Social/dramatic benefit]

**Example Custom Cantrip: Frost Touch**
- **Mind:** 1d6 cold damage, target slowed (calculated application)
- **Awareness:** 1d6 cold damage, sense target's body heat (instinctive)
- **Will:** 1d6 cold damage, works at negative Flow (reliable)
- **Presence:** 1d6 cold damage, creates frost patterns (+1 intimidate)

## Narrative Uses for Cantrips

Beyond mechanical effects, cantrips show magical nature:

**Social Situations:**
