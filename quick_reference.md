## BASIC MECHANICS

### Core Resolution System

**Basic Roll:** 2d6 + Attribute + Skill

Roll two six-sided dice, add your relevant attribute modifier (ranging from -5 to +5) and your skill rating (ranging from -2 to +8). Compare the total to the target number to determine your success.

**Standard Target Number:** 8 (moderate difficulty)

**Difficulty Scale:**
- **Trivial (TN 6):** Routine tasks under pressure
- **Easy (TN 7):** Basic professional work
- **Standard (TN 8):** Challenging professional tasks
- **Hard (TN 10):** Expert-level challenges
- **Extreme (TN 12):** Near-impossible feats
- **Legendary (TN 14):** Mythic achievements

**Success Tiers:**
- **6 or less:** Failure (generates Flow for opponent or creates consequences)
- **7-9:** Partial Success (succeeds with a cost or complication)
- **10-12:** Full Success (achieves your goal as intended)
- **13+:** Critical Success (generates extra Flow and exceptional results)
- **Beat TN by 5+:** Enhanced Success (gain advantage on next roll)
- **Beat TN by 8+:** Legendary Success (major narrative permission)

### The Flow System

Flow is the central resource that powers combat techniques, spells, and narrative advantages. It represents your character's momentum, focus, and command of the situation.

**Flow Range:** -3 to +6 (reduced from original)

**Starting Flow:** 0 (neutral position)
- **Exception:** Scholars start each scene at +1 Flow

**Flow States:**
- **Positive Flow (+1 to +6):** "In the flow," riding momentum, advantage
- **Zero Flow (0):** Neutral state, balanced position
- **Negative Flow (-1 to -3):** Disrupted, struggling, disadvantage

**Generating Flow:**
- Critical success on any roll: +1 Flow
- Successful attack in Aggressive stance: +1 Flow
- Successful defense in Defensive stance: +1 Flow
- Being attacked while in Defensive stance: +1 Flow (once per round)
- Taking any damage: +1 Flow (new rule - helps all characters maintain momentum)
- Casting a cantrip successfully: +1 Flow
- Archetype abilities (varies)
- Calling-specific triggers (rebalanced for reliability)

**Spending Flow:**
- Enhance dice rolls (+1 per point spent)
- Trigger combat techniques (varies by technique)
- Cast intermediate and advanced spells (-1 to -3)
- Access narrative advantages (GM discretion)
- No cost for stance switching (revised from original)

#### Flow Spending Quick Reference

|----------|---------|-----------|
| **General** | Enhance any roll | +1 per Flow spent |
| | | |
| **Spells** | Cantrip (Tier 0) | 0 |
| | Basic Spell (Tier 1) | 0 |

| | | |
| **Defensive** | Arcane Ward (reduce damage by 1d6+Mind) | 1 |

> **Signature Moves:** At moderate milestone, you can create a personal version of any technique you know. Your signature version costs 1 less Flow (minimum 0).

**Core Philosophy:** Flow is moment-to-moment momentum that ebbs and flows naturally. All character types can generate Flow through their preferred playstyle - aggressive fighters through offense, defensive fighters through protection, and spellcasters through magical success.

### Attribute System

**Attribute Range:** -5 to +5 (0 = human average)

**The Six Attributes:**

**Physical Attributes**
- **Might:** Raw physical power, strength, and endurance
- **Grace:** Agility, coordination, precision, and speed

**Mental Attributes**
- **Mind:** Intellect, reasoning, calculation, and knowledge
- **Awareness:** Perception, intuition, and attunement to surroundings

**Social Attributes**
- **Will:** Mental fortitude, determination, and spiritual power
- **Presence:** Charisma, force of personality, and social influence

**Key Principle - Approach Matters:** When making a check, you use the specific attribute that matches your approach, not a predetermined attribute for each skill.

*Example: Intimidating someone could use:*
- **Might** if physically threatening them
- **Mind** if pointing out logical consequences
- **Presence** if using sheer force of personality

### Skill System

Skills represent your character's training and expertise in various areas. Each skill has five possible ratings:

**Five-Tier Progression:**
1. **Untrained** (-2 modifier): No formal training
2. **Novice** (-1 modifier): Basic understanding
3. **Competent** (+0 modifier): Functional capability
4. **Professional** (+1 modifier): Skilled practitioner
5. **Expert** (+2 modifier): Peak human mastery

**Advancement Limits by Milestone Type:**
- **Starting Characters:** Maximum Competent (+0), one Professional (+1) from archetype
- **Minor Milestones:** Can advance skills up to Professional (+1)
- **Moderate Milestones:** Can advance skills to Expert (+2)

**The 15 Core Skills:**

**Physical Skills (5)**
- **Combat:** Fighting, weapons, and tactical positioning
- **Athletics:** Running, climbing, swimming, and feats of strength
- **Stealth:** Hiding, sneaking, and avoiding detection
- **Survival:** Tracking, living off the land, and navigation
- **Finesse:** Fine manipulation, lockpicking, and sleight of hand

**Mental Skills (5)**
- **Lore:** History, academics, and specialized knowledge
- **Medicine:** Healing, anatomy, and treating injuries
- **Craft:** Making, repairing, and engineering objects
- **Investigate:** Searching, analyzing, and finding clues
- **Sorcery:** Magical theory and spellcasting practice

**Social Skills (5)**
- **Persuade:** Convincing others through reason and charm
- **Deceive:** Lying, disguising, and misdirection
- **Perform:** Entertainment, inspiration, and artistic expression
- **Command:** Leadership, intimidation, and issuing orders
- **Empathy:** Understanding others' emotions and motivations

### Physical Skill Decision Tree

When determining which physical skill to use, ask these questions:

**Is this combat-related (attacking, defending, tactical positioning)?**
- Yes → Use **Combat**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve delicate manipulation or precise finger work?**
- Yes (lockpicking, disarming traps, sleight of hand, pickpocketing) → Use **Finesse**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve avoiding detection or moving unseen?**
- Yes (hiding, sneaking, tailing someone) → Use **Stealth**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve outdoor survival or wilderness skills?**
- Yes (tracking, foraging, navigation, animal handling) → Use **Survival**
- No → Continue

**Does it involve physical exertion or strength?**
- Yes (climbing, jumping, swimming, running, breaking down doors) → Use **Athletics**

**Common Examples:**
- **Climbing a wall:** Athletics (physical exertion)
- **Climbing a wall silently:** Athletics + Stealth (GM might require two rolls or grant advantage)
- **Picking a lock:** Finesse (delicate manipulation)
- **Breaking down a door:** Athletics (strength/force)
- **Dodging an attack in combat:** Combat (tactical defense)
- **Jumping over a pit:** Athletics (physical feat)
- **Sneaking past guards:** Stealth (avoiding detection)
- **Tracking a creature:** Survival (wilderness skill)
- **Disarming a trap:** Finesse (delicate work)

**Attribute Choice Matters:**
Remember, your approach determines which attribute pairs with the skill:
- **Might + Athletics:** Forcing a door, carrying heavy loads
- **Grace + Athletics:** Acrobatic maneuvers, parkour
- **Might + Combat:** Heavy weapon strikes, shield bashing
- **Grace + Combat:** Finesse weapon attacks, dodging
- **Grace + Finesse:** Standard lockpicking, sleight of hand
- **Mind + Finesse:** Complex locks requiring understanding mechanisms

### Scene Resolution

Most gameplay occurs in scenes that follow this structure:

1. **Set the Scene:** GM describes situation and stakes
2. **Declare Approach:** Players state what they're trying to do and how
3. **Determine Roll:** GM assigns appropriate Attribute + Skill combination
4. **Roll Dice:** Player rolls 2d6 + Attribute + Skill
5. **Interpret Results:**
   - **6-:** Failure or complication
   - **7-9:** Success with a cost
   - **10-12:** Full success
   - **13+:** Critical success
6. **Narrate Outcome:** GM and player collaborate on describing what happens
7. **Flow Adjustments:** Award or deduct Flow based on outcome

### Dice Conventions

**Standard Roll:** 2d6 + modifiers
**Advantage Die:** Add 1d6, keep highest two
**Disadvantage:** Roll 3d6, keep lowest two
**Exploding Dice:** On damage rolls, any die showing a 6 is rolled again and added

### Example Resolution

**Scenario:** Climbing a crumbling tower while under arrow fire.

**Player:** "I'll use my climbing experience to find the most stable route, testing stones before putting my weight on them."

**GM:** "That's Athletics, but your careful approach uses Awareness rather than Might. Roll Awareness + Athletics."

**Player:** "I have Awareness +2 and Athletics at Competent (+0), so that's 2d6+2."

*Rolls 2d6: 4, 3 = 7, plus 2 = 9*

**GM:** "A 9 is a partial success. You make it up, but one of the stones you thought was stable breaks loose. You're hanging by one hand, and will need another check to pull yourself up before the next volley of arrows."

**Player:** "I'll spend 1 Flow to boost my roll to 10 for a full success instead."

**GM:** "Perfect. You catch yourself as the stone breaks and smoothly pull up to the next level just as arrows thunk into the spot where you were hanging."

# COMBAT SYSTEM

## Stance-Based Combat

Rather than using traditional initiative rolls, this game uses a stance system that determines turn order based on tactical choices. Each round, you choose one of three stances that reflect your approach to the fight.

### The Three Stances

**Aggressive Stance**
*"Strike first, strike hard"*

- **Turn Order:** Act first
- **Flow Generation:** +1 Flow on successful attacks
- **Damage Bonus:** +1 to all damage rolls
- **Defense Penalty:** -1 to defense rolls
- **Movement:** Must move toward nearest enemy if able
- **Special Ability:** Charge - Move 2+ zones and attack for +2 damage

**Balanced Stance**
*"Adapt and overcome"*

- **Turn Order:** Act second
- **Flow Generation:** +1 Flow on any critical success
- **Damage:** Normal
- **Defense:** Normal
- **Movement:** Complete freedom
- **Special Ability:** Once per combat, switch stance as a free action

**Defensive Stance**
*"Patience and protection"*

- **Turn Order:** Act last (choosing your moment)
- **Flow Generation:** +1 when attacked, +1 on successful defense
- **Damage Penalty:** -1 to damage rolls
- **Defense Bonus:** +2 to defense rolls
- **Movement:** Can disengage without penalty
- **Special Ability:** Counterattack on critical defense success

### Stance Switching Rules

Stance switching is now **free** (no Flow cost). You can change your stance at the start of each round based on tactical needs. The Balanced stance special ability allows one additional stance change during combat as a free action.

### Turn Order Specifics

1. **Aggressive stance characters** act first (pressing the attack)
2. **Balanced stance characters** act second 
3. **Defensive stance characters** act last (waiting to react)

Within each stance group, highest Grace acts first, with ties favoring players over NPCs.

---

## Flow Zones & Positioning

Combat occurs across abstract distance zones that determine engagement and weapon effectiveness.

### The Three Core Zones

**Engaged**
- In melee with specific opponents
- Melee weapons operate normally
- Cannot use bows or other ranged weapons
- Switching weapons is free
- Cannot move past enemies without special abilities

**Close**
- One move from any engagement
- Throwing weapons operate at optimal range
- Bows and ranged weapons operate normally
- Can move into Engaged zone as normal movement
- Enemies can't directly attack you with melee weapons

**Far**
- Two moves from any engagement
- Optimal for bows and ranged attacks
- Melee fighters cannot attack targets at Far range
- Spells may still reach depending on description
- Safe from immediate melee threats

### Movement Between Zones

- **Standard Movement:** One zone per round
- **Double Movement:** Two zones if taking no other action
- **Engagement:** Moving into the same zone as an enemy puts you in Engaged position
- **Disengagement:** Moving from Engaged to Close requires specific stance or abilities

### Stance Effects on Movement

**Aggressive Stance Movement:**
- Moving Far → Close → Engaged generates +1 Flow per zone crossed
- Cannot disengage from enemies without switching stance
- Must close to Engaged if possible (seeking combat)

**Balanced Stance Movement:**
- Normal movement (one zone per round)
- Can choose to engage or disengage as preferred
- Can move two zones if taking no other action

**Defensive Stance Movement:**
- Can disengage from Engaged to Close freely
- Gains +1 Flow when enemies close to Engaged with you
- Can maintain preferred distance more easily

### Ranged Combat by Zone

- **Engaged:** Cannot use bows, -2 penalty with thrown weapons
- **Close:** Thrown weapons gain +1 Flow, bows work normally
- **Far:** Optimal for bows (+1 damage), thrown weapons cannot reach

## Health System
## Health System

Characters have two health resources that work together to model both minor and serious injuries.

### Guard

Guard represents your ability to avoid serious harm through armor, dodging, tactical positioning, and mental fortitude.

- **Formula:** 12 + max(Might, Grace, Will)
- **Function:** Ablative defense that absorbs damage first
- **Recovery:** Fully restored between scenes
- **In-Combat Recovery:** Can use Rally action to recover 1d6 Guard (once per scene)

**Why Three Options?**
Using the highest of Might, Grace, or Will allows tough fighters (high Might), agile defenders (high Grace), and mentally resilient characters (high Will) to all be effective. This is especially important for casters who typically have high Will but low physical attributes.

> **Note:** Guard is NOT a target number for attacks. Attacks always roll against TN 8 (or higher per GM guidance). Guard is an HP pool that absorbs damage from successful hits.

**Archetype Bonuses:**
Some archetypes provide additional Guard through their features:
- **Divine Grace** (Paladin, Cleric): +4 Guard
- **Arcane Battery** (Wizard): +2 Guard

### Vitality

Vitality represents your core health and ability to withstand serious injury.

- **Formula:** 10 + Will
- **Function:** Core health representing serious injury
- **Consequences:** Damage to Vitality often causes lasting effects
- **Critical Point:** At 0 Vitality, you fall unconscious and begin dying

**Increasing Vitality:**
Vitality can be increased through milestone choices (see Advancement), but does not scale automatically. This keeps death meaningful throughout the campaign.

### Damage Resolution

1. Attacker rolls damage (typically weapon dice + modifiers)
2. Subtract armor damage reduction (if any)
3. Remaining damage is applied to Guard first
4. Once Guard is depleted, further damage reduces Vitality
5. At 0 Vitality, character falls unconscious and begins dying

### Death & Dying Rules

When reduced to 0 Vitality, you fall unconscious and begin dying.

**Death Saves:** Roll 2d6 + Will at the start of each turn:
- **6 or less:** Lose 1 Vitality (getting worse)
- **7-8:** Stable for this round
- **9-11:** Stabilize at 0 Vitality (unconscious but stable)
- **12+:** Regain consciousness at 1 Vitality

**Death:** Occurs at -3 Vitality (down from -5)
**Stabilization:** Medicine check (TN 8) or any magical healing
**Recovery:** Regain 1 Vitality per hour of rest after stabilization

---

## Combat Actions

### Basic Actions

**Attack**

# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

## The Milestone System

This game uses milestone-based advancement instead of experience points. Milestones represent significant moments of character growth and development that occur naturally through the story.

### Philosophy Behind Milestones

- **Story-Driven Growth:** Characters advance when the narrative calls for it
- **No Bookkeeping:** No need to track XP or calculate advancement
- **GM Control:** The GM determines when milestones occur based on story pacing
- **Equal Advancement:** All characters reach milestones together

### Types of Milestones

There are three tiers of milestones, each representing a different magnitude of character development:

1. **Minor Milestones:** Small but meaningful growth (individual development)
2. **Moderate Milestones:** Substantial character development (group achievement)
3. **Major Milestones:** Transformative evolution (campaign-defining moments)

---

## Minor Milestones

Minor milestones occur frequently and represent individual character growth moments.

### When to Award Minor Milestones

- After completing a single session
- Upon resolving a challenging encounter
- When characters make a small but meaningful discovery
- After successful use of skills in a significant way
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 1-2 sessions

### Minor Milestone Options

Choose ONE of the following when you reach a minor milestone:

**Skill Development**
- Advance one skill up one tier (Untrained → Novice → Competent → Professional)
- Gain a new skill at Novice level (-1)
- Note: Cannot advance beyond Professional tier (+1) with minor milestones

**Attribute Adjustment**
- Adjust one attribute by +1/-1 (representing shift in focus or retraining)
- Total attribute points must remain the same
- Example: Lower Grace by -1 to raise Mind by +1

**Combat Edge**
- Gain a minor combat improvement (see Combat Edges list below)
- Edges provide incremental power growth
- Can take same Edge multiple times if limit allows

**Skill Edge**
- Gain +1 to specific application of a skill
- Example: +1 to Athletics when climbing
- Narrows focus for specialized expertise

**Flow Edge**
- Increase maximum Flow capacity by +1 (can take up to 3 times)
- Example: Increases max Flow from +6 to +7

### Combat Edges

Minor improvements that provide incremental power growth. Some edges can be taken multiple times up to their limit.

| Edge | Benefit | Limit |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Weapon Focus** | +1 damage with one weapon type | Once per weapon type |
| **Armor Training** | Reduce armor penalty by 1 | Once per armor type |
| **Tough** | +2 Guard | Twice |
| **Hardy** | +2 Vitality | Twice |
| **Quick Draw** | Switch weapons as free action | Once |
| **Combat Reflexes** | +1 to defense rolls | Once |
| **Fast Movement** | +1 zone of movement per turn | Once |
| **Precise Strike** | Reroll one damage die per attack | Once |
| **Flow Harmony** | +1 maximum Flow capacity | Three times |
| **Defensive Fighter** | +1 Guard when in Defensive stance | Once |

### Minor Milestone Example

*After successfully infiltrating the governor's mansion and discovering evidence of corruption, the party reaches a minor milestone.*

**Elena (Cleric)** chooses to adjust her attributes, lowering Presence by -1 to raise Awareness by +1, reflecting her growing perceptiveness to danger.

**Magnus (Fighter)** learns the Press Advantage combat technique, allowing him to deal +1d6 damage when his Flow is positive.

**Lyra (Wizard)** advances her Investigate skill from Competent (+0) to Professional (+1), having honed her analytical abilities during the mission.

### Appropriate Challenges After Minor Milestones

Characters who have experienced a few minor milestones are appropriate for:
- Local threats (bandits, wolves, minor undead)
- Small-scale local problems
- Threats to villages or small communities

---

## Damage Scaling

Your damage output increases automatically as you gain milestones, keeping pace with enemy advancement:

**Milestone Damage Bonus:**
- **Every 2 Milestones:** +1 damage with all attacks
- **At 5 Total Milestones:** Weapon damage die increases (d6 → d8)
- **At 10 Total Milestones:** Gain exploding dice (6s are rerolled and added)
- **At 15 Total Milestones:** Weapon die increases again (d8 → d10)

**Example Progression:**
- **Start (0 milestones):** 2d6 + Might = 10 avg damage
- **2 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 1 = 11 avg damage
- **4 milestones:** 2d6 + Might + 2 = 12 avg damage
- **5 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 2 = 13 avg damage
- **10 milestones:** 2d8 + Might + 5 (with exploding) = 18 avg damage

This progression ensures martial characters remain effective against increasingly powerful threats throughout a campaign.

---

**Elena (Cleric)** chooses attribute improvement, increasing her Will from +2 to +3, reflecting her strengthened resolve.

**Magnus (Fighter)** develops his Signature Move "Thundering Blow" - a devastating strike that costs 2 Flow (normally 3) and creates an intimidating shockwave, combining his Combat technique with his Champion Calling.

**Lyra (Wizard)** gains the advanced technique Perfect Parry, allowing her to completely negate damage from one attack by spending 3 Flow, representing her mastery of defensive magic.

---

## Signature Moves System

Signature Moves represent a character's unique fighting style or magical technique. They are created at moderate milestones and evolve as characters advance.

### Creating a Signature Move

**Core Components:**
1. **Mechanical Effect:** What the move does (damage, protection, etc.)
2. **Flow Cost:** Normally costs 1 less than standard (minimum 0)
3. **Thematic Element:** How it reflects your character

**Inspiration Sources:**
- Your Archetype's traditional techniques
