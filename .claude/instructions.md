## Design Principles Reference

These core principles should guide all design decisions:

1. **Elegance over Complexity**

   - Simple, unified resolution system
   - Minimal bookkeeping and calculation
   - Deep decision space without excessive rules

2. **Narrative-First with Tactical Depth**

   - Story drives mechanics, not vice versa
   - Tactical options for those who want them
   - Every rule supports the fiction

3. **Momentum as Universal Resource**

   - Single resource unifying all subsystems
   - Dynamic economy creating dramatic pacing
   - Intuitive resource that mirrors character momentum

4. **Player Agency**

   - Meaningful choices in character building
   - Tactical decisions in combat
   - Narrative permissions granting special capabilities

No adding language to documents that speak of updates, changes or any reference to anything prior. For example, "Stance switching is now free (no Momentum cost)."

Archetypes should not get bonuses, of themselves, give any sort of bonuses. Archetypes are templates that bring together skills, suggested attribute arrays and so on from the rest of the system.
