# Adventuring Gear

_Tools, Equipment, and Practical Solutions_

## Philosophy of Adventuring Gear

Adventuring gear represents the practical equipment characters use to overcome challenges beyond direct combat—exploration tools, survival equipment, social implements, and specialized devices enabling problem-solving through preparation and ingenuity.

In Autumn Phoenix RPG, adventuring gear creates opportunities for creative solutions and rewards thoughtful preparation. The right tool at the right moment can generate Momentum, bypass obstacles elegantly, or transform impossible challenges into manageable problems. Equipment selection becomes an expression of character identity and anticipated challenges rather than mere inventory management.

## Using Adventuring Gear Effectively

Effective equipment use in Autumn Phoenix follows several principles:

### The Right Tool for the Job

Using appropriate equipment for specific tasks often provides mechanical advantages—advantage on checks, automatic success, or reduced difficulty. Characters with rope and grappling hooks climb more effectively than those improvising. Those with proper lockpicks succeed where improvised tools fail.

### Creative Application

Equipment can be applied creatively beyond obvious uses. Rope becomes trip lines, improvised bindings, or climbing aids. Oil creates slippery surfaces or accelerants. Chalk marks trails or reveals invisible surfaces. The GM should reward creative thinking with mechanical benefits or Momentum generation.

### Preparation and Planning

Characters who anticipated needs and brought appropriate equipment generate Momentum when their preparation pays off. The ranger who brought antitoxin for the known poisonous swamp, the rogue who packed smoke bombs for the expected ambush—these choices reward strategic thinking.

### Encumbrance Trade-offs

Limited carrying capacity forces meaningful choices about what to bring. Characters can't carry everything, so equipment selection becomes strategic—balancing likelihood of need against encumbrance cost.
