# Magical Items

_Enchantments, Wonders, and Arcane Equipment_

## Philosophy of Magical Items

Magical items in Autumn Phoenix RPG represent significant treasures rather than expected equipment progression. While mundane equipment provides consistent capabilities, magical items offer exceptional powers, unique abilities, and effects impossible through ordinary means.

The magical item system emphasizes distinctive capabilities over simple numerical improvements. A +1 weapon is valuable, but a sword that ignites on command or a ring allowing limited flight tells stories and creates memorable moments that pure statistics cannot match.

## Rarity and Availability

Magical items exist in tiers of rarity affecting both cost and availability:

### Common Magical Items

**Availability**: Can be purchased in major cities
**Cost**: 50-150 sp

Common magical items provide minor conveniences - a lantern that never needs oil, a cloak that keeps you dry in rain, a knife that stays sharp. They're useful without fundamentally changing character capabilities. Successful adventurers can afford these baseline magical tools.

### Uncommon Magical Items

**Availability**: Found as treasure, commissioned from skilled enchanters
**Cost**: 200-500 sp (if purchasable)

Uncommon magical items provide meaningful tactical benefits worth building around. A sword that bursts into flame on command, boots that let you walk on water, armor that mends itself overnight. Most magical weapons and armor fall into this category.

### Rare Magical Items

**Availability**: Major treasure finds, rewards from powerful patrons
**Cost**: 750-2000 sp (rarely available for purchase)

Rare magical items significantly enhance character capabilities. A cloak of invisibility, a helm that lets you read thoughts, a blade that drinks the souls of the fallen. Characters often become known for these signature pieces of equipment.

### Very Rare Magical Items

**Availability**: Climactic treasure, legendary rewards
**Cost**: Generally not purchasable

Very rare magical items are campaign-defining treasures. A ring of wishes, armor forged by gods, a staff that commands storms. Finding such an item represents a major achievement and creates new strategic possibilities for the entire party.

### Legendary Magical Items

**Availability**: Unique artifacts, campaign centerpieces
**Cost**: Not purchasable

Legendary items are unique artifacts with histories, personalities, and world-shaking capabilities. The sword that killed a god, the crown of a fallen empire, the book that contains all mortal knowledge. These are story elements as much as equipment.

## Attunement

Some powerful magical items require attunement—forming a bond between item and user:

### Attunement Mechanics

- Attunement requires one hour of focused interaction with the item
- Characters can attune to maximum of three items simultaneously
- Breaking attunement is instantaneous but requires actively choosing to do so
- Most uncommon or higher items require attunement
- Common items typically don't require attunement

### Attunement Limits

The three-item limit forces meaningful choices about which magical items to use. Characters must decide whether a new item is worth breaking attunement with an existing one.

## Identifying Magical Items

Characters can identify magical items through several methods:

### Examination and Experimentation (Free)

Trying to use items, testing their properties, or careful examination might reveal properties (at GM discretion).

### Identify Spell (Ritual)

Wizards can cast identify ritual to learn item properties reliably.

### Expert Consultation (10-50 sp)

Bringing items to knowledgeable NPCs—wizards, sages, priests—can provide identification services.

## Magical Item Creation

Characters with appropriate skills can create magical items:

### Requirements

- Spellcasting ability or specific arcane knowledge
- Appropriate tools and workspace
- Time and resources for enchantment
- GM approval and guidance

### Common Item Creation

**Cost**: Half market value in materials
**Time**: 1 week per 50 sp of value
**Requirements**: Appropriate spell knowledge or magical skill

### Uncommon Item Creation

**Cost**: Half market value in materials
**Time**: 1 week per 100 sp of value
**Requirements**: Advanced magical knowledge, appropriate spells

### Rare or Higher Item Creation

Typically requires quest-level components, extraordinary knowledge, or unique circumstances rather than just time and gold.

## Cursed Items

Some magical items carry curses alongside benefits:

### Cursed Item Mechanics

- Curses aren't revealed by casual identification
- Breaking curses usually requires remove curse spell or quest
- Some cursed items have benefits worth tolerating curses
- Cursed items often can't be unequipped until curse is broken

### Example Cursed Items

**Berserker Axe**: +2 weapon but wielder must attack nearest creature while in combat (cannot distinguish friend from foe)

**Armor of Vulnerability**: Appears as +1 armor but actually grants vulnerability to one damage type

**Ring of Spell Stealing**: Stores spells cast near wearer but randomly releases them at inopportune moments

## Magical Items in Your Campaign

Magical items should feel special rather than expected:

### Distribution Guidelines

- Common items: Can be purchased or found relatively easily
- Uncommon items: Significant treasure finds or rewards
- Rare items: Major achievements or important discoveries
- Very Rare items: Campaign milestone rewards
- Legendary items: Unique artifacts central to story

### Making Items Memorable

- Give items histories and names
- Tie items to story events or NPCs
- Let items evolve or unlock new abilities
- Create items with personalities or quirks
- Design custom items reflecting character concepts

The most memorable magical items aren't always the most powerful—they're the ones that create great stories, enable creative tactics, or perfectly embody character concepts.
