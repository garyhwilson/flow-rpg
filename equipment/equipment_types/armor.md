# Armor
*Protection, Trade-offs, and Defensive Strategy*

## Philosophy of Armor in Flow

Armor in Flow RPG represents meaningful defensive choices rather than simple numerical progression. Each armor category offers distinct advantages balanced by corresponding limitations, creating tactical decisions that significantly impact combat approach, character capabilities, and resource management.

The armor system integrates with Flow's core mechanics through multiple vectors—damage reduction, attribute penalties, stance restrictions, and spellcasting limitations. These interactions ensure armor choice influences overall character strategy rather than serving as a simple "equip the best armor available" decision.

## Understanding Armor Categories

Armor categories represent fundamental approaches to protection, each trading different capabilities for defensive benefits. The right armor choice depends on character attributes, combat role, spellcasting needs, and tactical preferences.

### No Armor

Fighting unarmored represents a deliberate choice emphasizing mobility, stealth, spellcasting capability, or reliance on defense through agility rather than physical protection.

**Damage Reduction**: 0
**Penalties**: None
**Flow Bonus**: +1 Flow when taking damage
**Casting**: +1 bonus to Sorcery checks (unrestricted magical flow)
**Special**: Extra zone of movement per turn
**Best For**: Spellcasters, Grace-focused characters, stealthy characters, unarmored defense specialists

#### Tactical Implications

Unarmored characters rely on avoiding damage rather than absorbing it. This approach demands careful positioning, tactical awareness, and effective use of defensive stances or abilities. Characters fighting unarmored typically build around high Grace for defense, use cover and positioning strategically, or possess supernatural defensive capabilities.

The lack of armor penalties means unarmored characters can fully leverage Grace-based abilities, generate Flow through movement freely, and cast spells without restrictions. This makes unarmored combat the default choice for dedicated spellcasters and characters emphasizing mobility.

#### Flow and Unarmored Combat

Unarmored characters can generate Flow through graceful combat—dodging attacks, moving fluidly through battle, performing acrobatic maneuvers, or demonstrating supernatural evasion. The lack of encumbrance enables Flow generation through movement-based actions without restriction.

#### Character Archetypes

**Wizards** almost universally fight unarmored to avoid casting penalties.

**Rogues** often eschew armor for maximum stealth and mobility.

**Monks and similar concepts** (built through appropriate archetype/calling combinations) rely on unarmored defense as a core concept.

**Bards** frequently remain unarmored to maintain full performance and casting capabilities.

### Light Armor

Light armor provides modest protection through flexible materials that don't significantly restrict movement, making it ideal for characters balancing defense against mobility needs.

**Damage Reduction**: 1
**Penalties**: None
**Flow Generation**: Normal
**Casting**: No penalty (compatible with spellcasting)
**Special**: +1 to initiative and movement rolls
**Weight**: 1 significant item slot
**Cost**: 20-40 sp

**Examples**: Leather armor, padded jerkin, hide armor, studded leather, reinforced cloth

#### Tactical Implications

Light armor suits characters who need protection but can't afford the mobility penalties or spellcasting restrictions of heavier armor. The -1 damage reduction meaningfully reduces incoming damage without imposing significant limitations.

The Sorcery casting penalty makes light armor viable for clerics and paladins (who use Will-based divine magic) while slightly hindering wizards and bards (who use Sorcery-based arcane magic). Characters with strong Sorcery can work around this penalty, but it's a genuine consideration.

#### Versatility and Adaptation

Light armor represents the sweet spot for many characters—providing meaningful protection without major drawbacks. Rangers, rogues who expect combat, bards who need some defense, and spellcasters operating in dangerous environments all find light armor appealing.

The lack of Grace penalties means light armor wearers can employ full mobility, use Grace-based combat effectively, and switch stances freely without additional encumbrance concerns.

#### Flow Generation

Light armor doesn't restrict Flow generation, allowing wearers to generate Flow through movement normally. This makes light armor compatible with mobile combat styles and tactics emphasizing positioning.

#### Character Archetypes

**Rangers** typically wear light armor as their primary protection.

**Rogues** use light armor when expecting combat without sacrificing stealth.

**Bards** wear light armor for protection while maintaining acceptable casting ability.

**Lightly-armored clerics** might choose light armor for mobility while accepting slightly reduced Sorcery.

### Medium Armor

Medium armor provides substantial protection through metal and reinforced construction, trading mobility and spellcasting ease for significant damage reduction.

**Damage Reduction**: 2
**Penalties**: -1 to Grace-based rolls
**Flow Generation**: Normal
**Casting**: -1 to Sorcery checks (minor restriction)
**Special**: Gain +1 Guard at the start of each scene
**Weight**: 2 significant item slots
**Cost**: 40-80 sp

**Examples**: Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, chainmail, banded armor

#### Tactical Implications

Medium armor suits characters prioritizing protection over mobility—clerics supporting frontlines, paladins balancing offense and defense, or fighters who need protection but can't afford heavy armor's stance restrictions.

The Grace penalty affects combat rolls using Grace + Combat, mobility checks, and Finesse-based actions. Characters with high Grace can compensate, but medium armor fundamentally shifts toward Might-based combat approaches.

The inability to generate Flow from movement is a significant drawback, eliminating charging bonuses and restricting Flow generation to successful attacks, defensive achievements, and tactical actions rather than positioning.

#### Spellcasting in Medium Armor

The -1 Sorcery penalty is manageable for most casters. Wizards with moderate Sorcery (+2 or higher) can cast reliably in medium armor, and elven casters ignore this penalty entirely due to Elven Focus.

Clerics and paladins can cast comfortably in medium armor with only a slight penalty, making it a popular choice for divine spellcasters expecting combat.

#### Balanced Protection

Medium armor represents a middle ground—better protection than light armor without the extreme restrictions of heavy armor. Characters wearing medium armor typically employ Balanced or Defensive stances, using their damage reduction to weather attacks while dealing consistent damage.

#### Character Archetypes

**Clerics** commonly wear medium armor for protection while maintaining spellcasting.

**Paladins** often use medium armor, balancing protection against combat effectiveness.

**Fighters** might wear medium armor when heavy armor's stance restrictions are too limiting.

**Versatile characters** choose medium armor when facing dangerous opponents without committing to heavy armor specialization.

### Heavy Armor

Heavy armor provides maximum damage reduction through comprehensive metal protection, sacrificing mobility, spellcasting ease, and Flow generation for exceptional defense.

**Damage Reduction**: 4
**Penalties**: -2 to Grace-based rolls
**Flow Penalty**: -1 to Flow generation from all sources
**Casting**: -3 to Sorcery checks (difficult but possible)
**Special**: Immune to forced movement and knockback effects
**Weight**: 3 significant item slots
**Cost**: 100-200 sp

**Examples**: Full plate, heavy field plate, splint mail, ornate plate armor

#### Tactical Implications

Heavy armor creates dedicated defenders capable of absorbing tremendous punishment while maintaining battlefield presence. The -4 damage reduction means many attacks deal minimal or no damage, making heavy armor wearers extraordinarily difficult to kill through conventional attacks.

The -2 Grace penalty significantly impacts Grace-based actions, making heavy armor wearers reliant on Might for combat effectiveness. Combined with the inability to use Aggressive stance, heavy armor fighters typically employ Defensive or Balanced stances, controlling space and protecting allies rather than maximizing personal damage output.

#### Combat Role Specialization

Heavy armor wearers fill specific tactical roles:

- **Frontline Anchors**: Holding positions against enemy advances
- **Ally Protection**: Intercepting attacks meant for vulnerable characters
- **Area Control**: Threatening zones enemies must respect
- **Durable Combatants**: Sustaining combat effectiveness despite heavy damage

The severe -4 spellcasting penalty makes heavy armor challenging for casters, though determined casters with high Sorcery bonuses can still cast effectively (especially elven casters who reduce the penalty to -3).

#### Flow and Heavy Armor

Despite mobility restrictions, heavy armor doesn't prevent Flow generation—it redirects it toward defensive achievements and combat excellence. Heavy armor wearers generate Flow by:

- Absorbing attacks without flinching
- Protecting vulnerable allies
- Holding critical positions under fire
- Demonstrating martial prowess in Defensive stance

#### Strength Requirements

While not mechanically required, heavy armor practically demands high Might. The encumbrance and Grace penalties make low-Might characters ineffective in heavy armor, and the stance restrictions favor Might-based combat.

#### Character Archetypes

**Defensive Fighters** specialize in heavy armor, creating nearly unkillable bulwarks.

**Guardian-focused Paladins** might wear heavy armor when protection matters more than spellcasting.

**Dwarven characters** naturally gravitate toward heavy armor due to high Might and durability focus.

**Formation Fighters** wear heavy armor when serving as immovable bulwarks.

## Shields

Shields provide Guard bonuses rather than damage reduction, offering a different defensive approach than armor. Shields can be combined with any armor category for layered protection.

### Small Shield

**Effect**: +1 Guard
**Penalties**: None
**Weight**: 1 significant item slot
**Cost**: 5 sp

Small shields provide modest Guard improvement without significant encumbrance. They're ideal for characters who want some defensive benefit without committing to larger shields' penalties.

**Best For**: Versatile combatants, characters who need one hand free occasionally, balanced fighting styles

### Large Shield

**Effect**: +2 Guard
**Penalties**: -1 Grace when attacking
**Weight**: 1 significant item slot
**Cost**: 10 sp

Large shields offer substantial Guard improvement with minor penalties. The Grace penalty when attacking reflects the challenge of fighting around the shield's bulk.

**Best For**: Defensive fighters, frontline combatants, characters prioritizing protection over offense

### Tower Shield

**Effect**: +3 Guard, can provide cover to adjacent ally
**Penalties**: -2 Grace for all actions
**Weight**: 2 significant item slots
**Cost**: 20 sp

Tower shields provide exceptional protection and allow shielding adjacent allies, but the severe Grace penalties make them specialist equipment for dedicated defensive characters.

**Best For**: Dedicated defenders, protectors, formation fighters, siege defense

## Armor and Species Interactions

Different species interact with armor in distinctive ways based on their physical and cultural characteristics:

### Dwarves and Armor

**Stone Endurance** works with any armor, providing layered protection. Dwarven characters wearing heavy armor become exceptionally durable, combining damage reduction with enhanced Vitality for extraordinary staying power.

Dwarven cultural traditions emphasize superior armor craftsmanship, with Dwarven-made armor providing exceptional reliability and durability.

### Elves and Armor

**Elven Focus** ignores the first point of armor penalty when casting spells. This makes light armor functionally penalty-free for elven casters and reduces medium armor's Sorcery penalty to -1.

Elven armor tends toward lighter categories, with cultural emphasis on graceful protection rather than heavy metal. Elven-crafted light armor often incorporates superior materials for enhanced protection without increased weight.

### Halflings and Armor

Halflings typically avoid heavy armor due to size and strength limitations. Light armor suits their preference for mobility and stealth, while medium armor represents their maximum practical protection.

Halfling-designed armor emphasizes concealability and comfort, often appearing as normal clothing while providing protective value.

### Humans and Armor

**Adaptable** allows humans to adjust to armor limitations more effectively than other species. Human characters can leverage this to compensate for armor penalties or specialize in particular armor types for maximum effectiveness.

Human armor designs vary tremendously based on regional traditions, from heavy plate to exotic materials and innovative constructions.

## Armor Modifications

Armor can be customized to provide specialized benefits or mitigate standard limitations:

### Reinforced Armor (25 sp)

**Effect**: +1 damage reduction vs. one specific damage type (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning, fire, cold, etc.)

Specialized reinforcement protects against particular threats—extra padding against bludgeoning, chainmail backing against slashing, heat-resistant treatments against fire.

### Lightweight Armor (30 sp)

**Effect**: Reduce Grace penalty by 1

Superior materials and optimized construction reduce encumbrance without sacrificing protection. This modification can make medium armor more mobile or heavy armor less restrictive.

### Silent Armor (20 sp)

**Effect**: Advantage on Stealth checks

Careful construction, padding at joints, and design optimization reduce armor noise. Particularly valuable for light armor worn by rogues or rangers.

### Quick-Release Armor (15 sp)

**Effect**: Can be removed in one action instead of several minutes

Specialized fasteners and design allow rapid armor removal—useful for situations requiring quick changes or emergency escapes.

### Decorated Armor (10-50 sp)

**Effect**: +1 to social checks with appropriate groups

Heraldry, religious symbols, cultural decorations, or impressive craftsmanship make armor serve social functions alongside protective ones. Cost varies based on decoration elaborateness.

## Cultural Armor Variants

- **Specialized modifications**: Custom features for specific tactics
- **Cultural masterworks**: Legendary craftsmanship from renowned artisans
- **Signature pieces**: Named armor with personal history and significance

## Armor Maintenance and Damage

While Flow doesn't track detailed armor condition, extended adventuring without maintenance can degrade armor effectiveness:

### Environmental Damage

- **Rust and Corrosion**: Extended water exposure, acidic environments
- **Weathering**: Desert sand, extreme cold, persistent moisture
- **Structural Stress**: Taking tremendous damage, critical hits, magical effects

### Maintenance Requirements

**Light Armor**: Minimal maintenance, easy to repair
**Medium Armor**: Regular cleaning and minor repairs
**Heavy Armor**: Significant maintenance, professional repair for major damage

### Quality and Durability

**Standard Armor**: May degrade without regular maintenance
**Superior Armor**: More resilient, maintains effectiveness longer
**Masterwork Armor**: Exceptional durability, rarely requires significant repair
**Dwarven-Made**: Legendary reliability, effectively maintenance-free

## Choosing Your Armor

Consider these factors when selecting armor:

1. **Primary Attributes**: High Grace suggests lighter armor, high Might enables heavier armor
2. **Combat Style**: Defensive, aggressive, versatile, or spellcasting focus
3. **Spellcasting Needs**: Arcane casters need light/no armor, divine casters can use medium
4. **Stance Preference**: Aggressive stance incompatible with heavy armor
5. **Species**: Elves gain casting benefits, dwarves excel in heavy armor, halflings favor light
6. **Party Composition**: Someone should wear heavy armor if possible
7. **Budget**: Heavy armor is expensive, especially quality pieces

The best armor matches your character concept while supporting your intended combat role. Don't automatically choose the heaviest armor your character can physically wear—consider whether the penalties align with your tactics and capabilities.

## Armor and Flow Strategy

Different armor categories influence Flow economy differently:

**No Armor**: Maximum Flow generation through movement and agility
**Light Armor**: Normal Flow generation with minimal restrictions
**Medium Armor**: Flow generation shifted toward combat actions rather than positioning
**Heavy Armor**: Flow generation through defensive achievements and martial excellence

Understanding how armor affects Flow generation helps characters develop effective resource management strategies aligned with their equipment choices.

## Special Armor Considerations
