_Tools of Combat and Conflict Resolution_

## Philosophy of Weapons in Autumn Phoenix

Weapons in Autumn Phoenix RPG represent more than mere damage-dealing instruments—they embody tactical choices, character expression, and approaches to conflict. Each weapon category offers distinctive advantages balanced by corresponding limitations, creating meaningful decisions rather than simple hierarchical progression from inferior to superior options.

The weapon system integrates seamlessly with Autumn Phoenix's stance mechanics, providing different tactical opportunities depending on how characters position themselves in combat. A reach weapon wielded by a defensive fighter creates different tactical possibilities than dual-wielded daggers used by an aggressive rogue, even when both characters possess similar attribute scores.

## Choosing Your Weapon

Weapons fall into three broad groups based on how they're wielded in combat. Each offers distinct tactical advantages while maintaining rough parity in overall effectiveness - the "best" weapon is the one that fits your fighting style.

### Light Weapons

Light weapons prioritize speed, precision, and versatility over raw damage output, making them ideal for characters emphasizing technique and mobility.

**Damage**: 2d6
**Special**: +1 to Finesse actions while wielding
**Momentum Generation**: Normal
**Weight**: Negligible to 1 significant item slot

**Examples**: Dagger, club, short sword, hand axe, kukri, stiletto, sickle, kama

#### Tactical Applications

Light weapons excel in situations requiring quick reactions, precise strikes, or maintained mobility. The Finesse bonus applies to any combat action based on technique rather than raw force—parrying attacks, striking vital points, disarming opponents, or performing acrobatic maneuvers while attacking.

These weapons pair exceptionally well with the Aggressive stance, allowing characters to maximize offensive pressure while maintaining defensive options through superior speed. In Balanced stance, light weapons provide excellent versatility, enabling rapid stance switches without significant equipment penalties.

#### Dual-Wielding

Most light weapons possess the Dual-Wield property, allowing characters to attack with both weapons at -1 penalty to each strike. This creates interesting tactical trade-offs:

- **Aggressive Dual-Wielding**: Maximum damage output through multiple attacks
- **Defensive Dual-Wielding**: Using off-hand weapon for parrying while attacking with primary
- **Mixed Approach**: Attacking with one weapon while using the other for utility actions

Dual-wielding generates Momentum when effectively employed—striking different targets, overwhelming a single opponent's defenses, or performing coordinated attack-and-defense sequences.

#### Character Archetypes

**Rogues** naturally gravitate toward light weapons, leveraging Finesse bonuses for precision strikes while maintaining mobility for tactical positioning.

**Bards** appreciate light weapons' versatility, as they can fight effectively without committing to heavy armament that might impede performance or spellcasting.

**Spellcasters** often carry light weapons as emergency options, benefiting from the minimal encumbrance and compatibility with casting-focused builds.

**Rangers** frequently employ light weapons in off-hand while using medium weapons as primaries, creating flexible combat options.

### Medium Weapons

Medium weapons represent the quintessential balanced armament—effective damage output without significant penalties, making them reliable choices for versatile combatants.

**Damage**: 2d6+1
**Special**: None
**Momentum Generation**: Normal
**Weight**: 1 significant item slot

**Examples**: Longsword, mace, battle axe, scimitar, warhammer, rapier, morningstar, falchion

#### Tactical Applications

Medium weapons provide consistent effectiveness across diverse tactical situations without specializing in particular approaches. This versatility makes them excellent choices for characters who frequently switch stances or adapt tactics to changing battlefield conditions.

The lack of penalties or bonuses means medium weapons neither encourage nor discourage particular tactical approaches, allowing character attributes and player decisions to determine combat style rather than equipment constraints.

#### Versatility in Combat

Medium weapons shine in their adaptability:

- Effective in both Aggressive and Defensive stances without modification
- Compatible with shields for defensive builds
- Sufficient damage output for dedicated combatants
- No Grace penalties hindering mobility or technique

This balanced profile makes medium weapons popular among professional soldiers, adventurers expecting diverse challenges, and characters preferring reliable effectiveness over specialized optimization.

#### Character Archetypes

**Fighters** frequently choose medium weapons for their consistent effectiveness across diverse combat scenarios.

**Paladins** often wield medium weapons with shields, creating durable combatants capable of sustained frontline presence.

**Clerics** appreciate medium weapons' balance between combat effectiveness and compatibility with spellcasting (when wearing appropriate armor).

**Rangers** commonly use medium weapons as primaries, switching to bows when range becomes advantageous.

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons sacrifice mobility and finesse for devastating damage output, appealing to characters built around overwhelming force.

**Damage**: 2d6+2
**Special**: -1 Grace while wielding
**Momentum Generation**: Normal
**Weight**: 2 significant item slots

**Examples**: Greatsword, maul, greataxe, flail, two-handed hammer, zweihander, nodachi

#### Tactical Applications

Heavy weapons excel at dealing maximum damage per strike, making them ideal for characters prioritizing offense over defense. The Grace penalty affects all Grace-based actions while wielding the weapon, including combat rolls using Grace + Combat, mobility checks, and Finesse maneuvers.

Characters wielding heavy weapons typically emphasize Might-based combat, leveraging superior strength to overcome the weapon's unwieldiness while maximizing damage output. The two-handed requirement prevents shield use, making Guard management through stance selection and positioning crucial.

#### Aggressive Fighting

Heavy weapons naturally synergize with Aggressive stance, accepting vulnerability in exchange for devastating attacks. Characters built around this combination become terrifying offensive threats capable of ending combats quickly through overwhelming damage.

However, heavy weapon users must carefully manage Momentum and positioning, as their reduced Grace makes defensive reactions more challenging. Smart heavy weapon wielders position themselves to minimize exposure to multiple enemies while maximizing damage against priority targets.

#### Momentum Generation and Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons can generate substantial Momentum through dramatic combat actions—cleaving through multiple enemies, shattering obstacles, and demonstrating overwhelming martial prowess. The key is leveraging the weapon's strengths while mitigating its defensive limitations.

#### Character Archetypes

**Fighters** built around Might naturally gravitate toward heavy weapons, accepting Grace penalties to maximize damage output.

**Barbarian-style characters** (using Fighter or Ranger archetypes with appropriate callings) pair perfectly with heavy weapons' aggressive nature.

**Dwarven characters** often favor heavy weapons, as their naturally high Might and lower Grace make the penalty less impactful.

### Reach Weapons

Reach weapons extend the wielder's threat range, enabling attacks from greater distance while maintaining space between the wielder and opponents.

**Damage**: 2d6
**Special**: Can attack from Close range (not just Engaged)
**Momentum Generation**: +1 when keeping enemies at bay
**Weight**: 1-2 significant item slots

**Examples**: Spear, pike, halberd, glaive, naginata, lance, partisan, trident

#### Tactical Applications

Reach weapons excel at zone control and defensive fighting, allowing characters to threaten enemies before they can close to striking distance. The ability to attack from Close range means reach weapon users can fight effectively while maintaining defensive positioning.

When enemies attempt to close distance, reach weapon wielders can make opportunity attacks as opponents enter their extended threat range. This creates natural synergy with Defensive stance, generating Momentum while preventing enemies from engaging freely.

#### Defensive Fighting

Reach weapons pair exceptionally well with defensive tactics:

- **Setting Reach**: Establishing position and forcing enemies to close through threatened zones
- **Keeping Distance**: Maintaining Close range to attack while avoiding enemy counterattacks
- **Supporting Allies**: Attacking enemies engaged with allies from safety of Close range
- **Controlling Space**: Using reach to threaten multiple approach vectors

Characters employing reach weapons defensively generate +1 Momentum when successfully keeping enemies at bay—forcing them to waste actions closing distance, preventing engagement, or protecting allies by threatening advancing foes.

#### Mobility and Positioning

Despite their length, reach weapons don't inherently penalize Grace. Skilled wielders use them to control battlefield positioning, making them popular among tactically-minded characters who prefer fighting smart rather than hard.

#### Character Archetypes

**Defensive Fighters** appreciate reach weapons' ability to control engagement while maintaining safety.

**Rangers** often employ reach weapons when fighting dangerous creatures better kept at distance.

**Formation Fighters** use reach weapons to support allies from second rank positions.

**Mounted Combatants** favor lances and similar reach weapons for devastating charge attacks.

### Thrown Weapons

Thrown weapons provide tactical flexibility through optional ranged attacks while remaining viable in melee, appealing to mobile skirmishers.

**Damage**: 2d6
**Special**: +1 Momentum when thrown from Close range
**Range**: Close (optimal), cannot reach Far
**Momentum Generation**: Normal melee, +1 when thrown
**Weight**: Light (negligible to 1 slot per 5 weapons)

**Examples**: Javelin, throwing knife, throwing axe, shuriken, chakram, dart, bolas

#### Tactical Applications

Thrown weapons excel as opening attacks and tactical responses to changing range situations. Characters can engage enemies at Close range with throwing attacks before switching to melee, or disengage from melee to throw while retreating.

The +1 Momentum when throwing from Close range rewards tactical throwing—engaging enemies before they expect combat, striking targets unable to respond effectively, or exploiting momentary vulnerabilities.

#### Skirmishing Tactics

Thrown weapon specialists employ hit-and-run tactics:

- **Opening Volleys**: Softening enemies before melee engagement
- **Tactical Disengagement**: Throwing while retreating to maintain damage output
- **Exploiting Mobility**: Attacking while moving between positions
- **Multi-Target Engagement**: Throwing at distant threats while engaged in melee with others

Characters built around thrown weapons typically emphasize mobility, using movement to maintain optimal range while wearing down opponents through sustained harassment.

#### Ammunition Considerations

Unlike arrows requiring specialized equipment to carry efficiently, thrown weapons can be retrieved after combat or carried in reasonable quantities. Most characters carry 3-5 thrown weapons, treating them as recoverable ammunition rather than expendable consumables.

#### Character Archetypes

**Rogues** use thrown weapons for opening strikes and as ranged options when stealth or mobility make melee inadvisable.

**Rangers** employ thrown weapons as secondary armament, bridging the gap between bow and melee ranges.

**Skirmishers** built around mobility and harassment make thrown weapons their primary armament.

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons enable attacks from significant distance, sacrificing melee capability for superior range and damage at distance.

**Damage**: 2d6 (Close), 2d6+1 (Far)
**Special**: +1 damage at Far range, -2 penalty when Engaged in melee
**Range**: Far (optimal), Close (normal), Engaged (severe penalty)
**Momentum Generation**: Normal
**Weight**: 1-2 significant item slots, plus ammunition

**Examples**: Shortbow, longbow, crossbow, heavy crossbow, composite bow, recurve bow

#### Tactical Applications

Ranged weapons excel at engaging enemies before they can respond in melee, providing support from protected positions, and eliminating priority targets before they become immediate threats.

The damage bonus at Far range rewards positioning and tactical awareness—maintaining distance to maximize effectiveness while avoiding situations where enemies can close to melee. The severe penalty when Engaged makes melee backup weapons essential for dedicated archers.

#### Archer Tactics

Effective archers employ several key tactics:

- **Maintaining Distance**: Positioning to attack from Far range whenever possible
- **Target Selection**: Eliminating dangerous enemies before they close
- **Supporting Fire**: Attacking enemies engaged with allies from safe distance
- **Tactical Repositioning**: Moving to maintain optimal range when enemies advance

Archers generate Momentum through exceptional shots—hitting difficult targets, shooting through cover, making impossible shots under pressure, or eliminating multiple enemies efficiently.

#### Ammunition Management

Arrows and bolts require tracking but aren't consumed on every shot. After combat, characters can typically recover about half their expended ammunition. A quiver holds approximately 20 arrows or bolts.

Running out of ammunition in extended engagements is a genuine concern, making ammunition management a tactical consideration for dedicated archers.

#### Character Archetypes

**Rangers** naturally build around ranged combat, using bows as primary weapons while maintaining melee backups.

**Fighters** can specialize in archery, creating effective ranged combatants with excellent accuracy.

**Rogues** sometimes employ ranged weapons for stealth attacks, though they often prefer thrown weapons' versatility.
